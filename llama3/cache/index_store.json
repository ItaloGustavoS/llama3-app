DANGER \nRISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS \nThe conveying belt remains under stress even when the belt conveyor is switched \noff. In case of work when the conveyor belt exerts a direct or indirect effect, \npretension must be neutralized by relieving the conveyor belt before starting the \nwork. This might result in a short movement of the conveyor belt and the take-up \ndevice. The conveyor belt must be constantly monitored for damages due to foreign substances. Any damage to the \nconveyor belt should be repaired as soon as possible. Minor damage can be repaired directly on the belt. Damage to the belt edges is also part of such immediate repairs. More extensive damage to the conveyor belt must be eliminated by the removal of the damaged belt section. IMPORTANT \nWork to the conveyor belt, vulcanisation and improvement of the damaged \nlocation(s) are to be carried out by certified specialist contractors. All connection and vulcanisation works must be executed by following precisely \nthe instructions of the belt and fastening material manufacturer. Replacement of conveyor belt \nï Run the conveyor belt empty \nï If emptying is not possible, remove material from the belt manually \n \n \nDANGER \n \nATTENTION IN CASE OF WORK IN ELEVATED POSITIONS! Maintenance personnel realizing cleaning work on the conveyor belt must use a \ncatching safety belt and/or personal safety equipment for protection against falling! Failure to observe this precaution could result in severe bodily injury or loss of life.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"r5c2/eUqxG+Bgy9vujIa3s7gT/7eFPLc1ZzetAT33wo="},"7cf5bc62-70f1-4b60-ae34-3e5ffb5cebd5":{"id_":"7cf5bc62-70f1-4b60-ae34-3e5ffb5cebd5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"480d7b9c-c38d-4b6a-bcf6-da39c4feff88","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"r5c2/eUqxG+Bgy9vujIa3s7gT/7eFPLc1ZzetAT33wo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f126e4aa-c1a0-45a1-9736-d988238dfa8e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"ahWz1t0I6hL4gzo9zgVhTCY//bUDiKp9qq3iFTIBs3M="}},"text":"Failure to observe this precaution could result in severe bodily injury or loss of life.

an open air coal storage (not in scope of supply) inside a power plant. The entire equipment consists of two main components: \nï Crusher station for twin truck feeding, \nï Belt conveyor system with 1 line for feeding the power plant open air stockpiles. The crusher station is designed to feed an apron feeder by trucks from 2 sides. During unloading, trucks \ndump the coal-xylitol-mix through a hopper to the loading surface of the apron feeder. It starts and carries the \nmaterial along a slope to its top point and discharges the load into a chute with a running impact crusher \nbelow. Big lumps of coal and long pieces of xylitol are cracked inside the crusher immediately and the outgoing \nmaterial falls through a chute to the loading table of the first belt conveyor with flowing sequence. The conveyor system consists of a continuous belt conveyor line involving conveyors U-1 to U-5 with a \ncommon length of 2937m.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Ws3k9fnl8sbQvFz8yruJVPUEKDf0XgB68CwVWzaRGqE="},"bb526725-91a2-41e5-a496-1b4c731f6789":{"id_":"bb526725-91a2-41e5-a496-1b4c731f6789","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f83202c8-b925-429e-9edd-b155ee011b1e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"Ws3k9fnl8sbQvFz8yruJVPUEKDf0XgB68CwVWzaRGqE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a9d3c693-dd6f-40e0-9251-d0d002402c70","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"rOwQdoJCT5PYLlsR9cjpItuTRKAMNAYDEm1LaZvNgBY="}},"text":"In the immediate vicinity of the crusher station, there is an operator cabin installed to control the handling \nprocess of the crushing station and the belt conveyor system.

It is the first drive in the conveying sequence and has a \ncapacity of three truck loads (two truck unloading ramps allow double unloading). During unloading operation, \nthe coal falls from the dump truck into a hopper at which base the apron feeder is situated. The material is \ntransported along a slope to the top point of the apron feeder where it is discharged into a further chute, which \nguides the coal directly into the crusher. Capacitive material detectors on the ground and on top report to the \ncontrol system if the chute is filled or free for a new truck unloading operation. The apron feeder consists basically of following main components: \nâ main frame, \nâ apron strand, \nâ driven tumbler, \nâ drive unit,  \nâ take-up unit, \nâ set of rollers, \nâ set of impact rails.

The pulling unit is formed by means of two track chains which \nare arranged in the double-link style. The individual aprons are fastened on the chain links. The gap between adjacent aprons is closed with a seal \nso that material cannot penetrate between the aprons even when moving around the sprocket wheels. The aprons are fabricated in welded design. The complete apron strand is guided in the upper run by means of rigidly fixed and maintenance-free track \nrollers. Below the apron strand, there are arranged impact rails which absorb the loading impact resulting \nfrom feeding operation. The return rollers are installed on both sides under the aprons. These rollers run on rails fitted to the carrying \nframe in the return strand. The chain is guided over a drive sprocket and a return sprocket.

Rotating at high speed (ca. 39 m/sec), the rotor placed in a housing lined with wear plates grasps \nthe feed material with great force and throws it against impact rockers. The impact rockers with oscillating \nsuspension are installed in the housing. The feed material is crushed between blow bars and impact rockers to the desired grain size. The impact \nrockers are arranged in a way so that the product is thrown back into the crushing radius. The output grain size can be determined and easily controlled from outside by adjusting the impact rockers, \nt.i., by altering the gap between the rotor and the impact rocker. Besides, the contact pressure can be changed by respective tensioning of the helical compression springs. The crushed material falls without time delay through the third chute onto the belt conveyor U-1 installed \nbelow the chute.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AW8JMQzn+Yt5ybYH0wgDffBwDL9iXhgWSOISQfu2HbM="},"2861c272-3320-438d-9002-d2325c805463":{"id_":"2861c272-3320-438d-9002-d2325c805463","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"30e9f1f6-ec33-402b-ba57-291e25c4d3f4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"AW8JMQzn+Yt5ybYH0wgDffBwDL9iXhgWSOISQfu2HbM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"210f8c49-5977-43ef-8596-e15a240b815e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"hSpkwMIzCZedgT2/dr+bam0McbqVZ8cNT+u5+lMu2sY="}},"text":"[Figure 1 - Impact Crusher PB 1822 PP - http://imeddata.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-crushed-material-falls-without-time-delay-through-the-third-chute-onto-the-belt-conveyor-U-1-installed-below-the-chute.png]\n\n[Figure 2 at center of the page]\n\n\nPage 165:\n \nProject: \nStanari  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevision: \n0 \nProject no.: 109794  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage: 12 of 12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFile name: \n109794_M4_CS_EN.docx \n \n1.5.2 Drive Unit \nThe impact crusher is driven by a narrow V-belt drive consisting of 18 V-belts 8V/25N with a pitch length of \n12700 mm. Tensioning and releasing of the tension is effected by three external take-up spindles. Drive unit and crusher have a fixed coupling via belt-drive. The motor and countershaft are connected via an \nelastic coupling. For that matter, the motor is energized via a frequency converter. Due to its volume, the \nrunning crusher has a high inertia torque and much kinetic energy. The FC allows a better and longer \ncontrolled start-up and shut-down after using. The start-up takes approx. 2 min. and the shut-down lasts \nabout 5 min. To detect any slipping between the drive unit and the crusher there are speed sensors installed on both sides. Both values will be compared to detect slipping before a different speed causes friction and heat to the V-\nbelts, which connect both sides - the motor and the machine.

\nDESIGN AND FUNCTION \n1.1 \nGeneral description \nThe belt conveying system with a crushing station are used for transporting coal, mixed with xylitol, from a \nnearby open cast mining to an open air coal storage (not in scope of supply) inside a power plant. The entire equipment consists of two main components: \nï Crusher station for twin truck feeding, \nï Belt conveyor system with 1 line for feeding the power plant open air stockpiles. The crushing station is designed to feed an apron feeder by trucks from 2 sides. During unloading, trucks \ndump the coal-xylitol-mix through a hopper to the loading surface of the apron feeder. It starts and carries the \nmaterial along a slope to its top point and discharges the load into a chute with a running impact crusher \nbelow. Big lumps of coal and long pieces of xylitol are cracked inside the crusher immediately and the outgoing \nmaterial falls through a chute to the loading table of the first belt conveyor with flowing sequence. The continuous conveyor line consisting of conveyors U-1 to U-5 transports the material further to the \nsecondary crushing equipment. In the immediate vicinity of the crusher station, there is an operator cabin installed to control the handling \nprocess of the crushing station and the belt conveyor system. This cabin is designed for a continuous \npresence of an operator.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vfGnO1iHPdxob7sa3WI0yB53JdDPUP0bAvzF8rUWeec="},"ad162096-a941-4fc9-8d23-30bd8438d249":{"id_":"ad162096-a941-4fc9-8d23-30bd8438d249","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"782995e8-fcf2-40c6-8031-81567a6324b1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"vfGnO1iHPdxob7sa3WI0yB53JdDPUP0bAvzF8rUWeec="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d4936c8a-38cb-49ef-8bd8-9e043bc59144","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"jWNXqGS+ILTe0e++jCmlieNb+RGZ6rsSJSP9BriO3DU="}},"text":"This cabin is designed for a continuous \npresence of an operator.

The conveyor system consists of a continuous belt \nconveyor line involving conveyors U-1 to U-5 with a capacity of 1000 t/h and common final length of approx. 2901 m. Almost at the end of the conveyor line, at the conveyor U-5, additional equipment is installed to check the \nincoming bulk material and to hold it clean. These are: \nï 1 magnetic separator, \nï 2 metal detectors before and after the separator and \nï 1 belt scale. The belt conveyors are the key drives for material handling. These drives are only switchable from the local \nrepair switch to enable the repair operation outside of interlocking. Further, each belt conveyor can be \nseparately locked in manual mode when the following conveyor is running. If all conditions are met, all \nconveyors in the conveying line in the semi-automatic operation start counter to the conveying direction and \nstop in the conveying direction. In the locked and semi-automatic operation, separate and independent switching of individual promoters \nwithin the line is not possible. The sequence described above is observed in all cases. In an emergency situation the system can be immediately shut-down by opening the emergency stop loop. This can be done by pulling a ripcord or by pressing a hardware red mushroom emergency stop button or a \nvirtual red mushroom emergency stop button on a monitor in the control room. The boot process is delayed by the respective start-warning time.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mNrSMckGHYlnJNwtggGv/HsdkRiH7y5696ezSseqqW8="},"d4936c8a-38cb-49ef-8bd8-9e043bc59144":{"id_":"d4936c8a-38cb-49ef-8bd8-9e043bc59144","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ad162096-a941-4fc9-8d23-30bd8438d249","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"mNrSMckGHYlnJNwtggGv/HsdkRiH7y5696ezSseqqW8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e062b715-045d-4fd4-8890-73bf5001a317","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"HAu2RpMpBdKUWmHKMfg/MMmYVn4LRlPl1+Eip/JSxmA="}},"text":"The boot process is delayed by the respective start-warning time.

The conveyor belt coming from the drive pulley is guided in the lower run \nover carrying idler stations to the take-up sledge. The necessary belt pre-tension is reached by shifting the \ntake-up sledge with the pulley by means of the spindles and spindle nuts. The sledge and the take-up spindles are installed in the steel construction. The tension way is built by two \nlongitudinal beams which are welded to the frame on both sides. Lift-off restraints hold the take-up sledge on \nthe longitudinal beams. The pedestal bearings of the take-up pulley are fastened on the take-up sledge. When installing the belt, the sledge should be brought into a definite position depending on the take-up way \nand secured there. The necessary pre-tension of the conveyor belt is effected by a mechanical pre-stressing (note the belt sag!). If due to the belt elongation the belt tension changes, it must be corrected by the take-up spindles. Before the take-up pulley, an inside belt cleaner is installed. 1.2.1.4 \nFeeding box \nThe feeding box is located in the tail part (end section of U1) and is used for receiving of conveyed material \nfrom the crusher chute and spillage from the apron feeder.

The conveyor U5 runs for the most part in a closed steel conveyor bridge. The bridge is elevated at an angle \nof 7.4Â° only in the first section (35 m) and has further a horizontal structure. After the return station the magnetic separator for ferromagnetic parts is arranged. In the successive conveyor \nbridge a belt weigher and another metal detector with an adjacent selecting line are installed. In case of danger emergency exits are provided on the left and right side of the steel bridge. The respective \nescape routes lead downstairs via ladders at the columns of the conveyor line. In the event of fire the conveyor line is protected inside the steel bridge by a fire extinguishing system. The \nsupply of the fire extinguishing system is located in a container installed at the column 5 of the conveyor \nbridge. For the purposes of maintenance of the conveyor interior, a wash-down system is provided. Wastewater and \nroof drainage run downwards in a water collecting system to the main drainage connection.

In the middle between the lower belt and the upper belt, there is installed a strong \nelectrical magnet which separates any ferrous parts from the conveyed material flow while the conveyor is \nrunning. From the area in the middle it carries the undesirable metal components sideward, where the \nmagnetic field is lower, and lets them fall into a collection container for recyclable metal parts. The metal piece discharge conveyor is hung in a steel construction with possibility of adjustment relatively to \nthe conveyor line. The steel construction consists of an upper and lower part. The lower part is rigidly \nfastened in the concrete ground by means of anchor bolts in the bottom plates. The steel construction is located at the beginning of the conveyor bridge and protected against atmospheric \neffects by a roof. For the purposes of maintenance and assembly of the magnetic separator, the upper part of \nthe steel construction can be removed and laid down sideways. The magnetic separator starts up only when the metal detector at the belt conveyor U-4 announces incoming \nmetal and it runs for several minutes. The magnetic separator doesnât run continuously together with the \nrunning conveyor U-5. 1.2.5.10 Belt weigher \nThe belt weigher is installed behind the feeding hopper U5. It is designed to acquire the instantaneous flow \nrate. The belt scale consists of at least one load cell, a speed sensor and the processing electronics. The load \ncell determines the weight of the load on a certain belt section (1 m), and the speed transducer measures the \nbelt speed. The product of the two measured variables results in the current feed rate in t/h. The data \nprovided are passed over to the existing interface of the PLC for further evaluation. The belt weigher is fastened on the stringers of the conveyor frame and equipped in the upper run with two 3-\npiece idler stations for weight acquisition. The belt weigher is installed in the first frame section of the \nconveyor line which is located at the beginning of the conveyor bridge.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hF0WC3TYYVySBbGpcdNosruQG0tgsRbsSbRRjZzdb8g="},"2a65d571-77b1-41a6-8a38-4aa75e2935a9":{"id_":"2a65d571-77b1-41a6-8a38-4aa75e2935a9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2c8390f4-7b9f-4506-bab6-d42bd441c1b8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"hF0WC3TYYVySBbGpcdNosruQG0tgsRbsSbRRjZzdb8g="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"af9e2a77-0a5e-444e-bb35-0369429fabe2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"klG2mbZ5eN924JZA5uvkmYFbQB+5LDoSoqIwDFpv28Y="}},"text":"[Figure 1 at center of the page]\n\n\nPage 190:\n \nProject: \nStanari  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevision: \n0 \nProject no.: 109794  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage: 25 of 25 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFile name: \n109794_M4_BC_EN_.docx \n \n1.2.5.11 Metal detector \nBehind the belt weigher, there is the second metal detector installed to recognize remaining undetected metal \nparts in the material flow. After detection of metal foreign bodies, a discharge station gets activated to \nfacilitate identification of the relevant location. In case of detection of metal parts in the material flow, the metal detector stops the belt conveyor. The metal detector is composed of a frame with a search coil. The metal detector generates an \nelectromagnetic field. If a metal object enters the field, the measurement signal is deflected in a certain \ndirection. When the metal object leaves the field, a deflection occurs in the opposite direction. If both \ntriggering limits of the signal are exceeded, the metal relay is switched. An electronic circuit with an adjustable trigger enables the detection and display of metal elements. An easy access to the conveyor is provided in the selecting line section. 1.2.5.12 Safety devices \nAll exposed rotating parts with the exception of the idlers are protected against accidental contact by boxes, \nwire mesh guards or railings. In cases of emergency the equipment can be turned off by means of emergency switches with relevant pull \ncords installed on both sides of the conveyor line. Actuation of the pull rope triggers immediately standstill of \nthe conveyor and of the technologically interconnected conveying devices. Visual and acoustic start-up signals are provided by a warning lamp and a horn. Safety and warning devices include also: \nâ Limit switches for take-up way limit, \nâ Misalignment switch, \nâ Speed sensor and/or slip controller, \nâ Belt damage control, \nâ Filling level sensor of hopper, \nâ Supplying of LED-lamps for the entire conveyor.

The straight running of the belt is influenced by the corresponding setting of the carrying idlers and pulleys. The following applies to carrying idlers: \r\nï The belt always runs to the side it meets first. The following applies in general: \r\nï Even small adjustment angles (Î±) cause lateral movements. ï The shifting (influencing) is effected slowly. The conveyor belt must be monitored for a longer period of time \r\nto ensure that it does not move to the opposite side. ï Slanted pulleys achieve significantly stronger effects and are therefore often the cause for misalignment. Therefore, only the correct alignment and straight position should be checked. Adjustment for the steering of \r\nthe belt should be avoided. ï Multi-part carrying idler stations are often equipped with a so-called camber of the two outer side rollers. In \r\nnormal position, these rollers are aligned symmetrically askew to the running direction of the belt. If such \r\nstations are installed in the wrong direction, they cause misalignment.

equipment is used for transporting coal, mixed with xylitol, from a nearby open cast \r\nmining to an open air coal storage (not in scope of supply) inside a power plant. The entire equipment consists of two main components: \r\nï Crusher station for twin truck feeding, \r\nï Belt conveyor system with 1 line for feeding the power plant open air stockpiles. The crusher station is designed to feed an apron feeder by trucks from 2 sides. During unloading, trucks \r\ndump the coal-xylitol-mix through a hopper to the loading surface of the apron feeder. It starts and carries the \r\nmaterial along a slope to its top point and discharges the load into a chute with a running impact crusher \r\nbelow. Big lumps of coal and long pieces of xylitol are cracked inside the crusher immediately and the outgoing \r\nmaterial falls through a chute to the loading table of the first belt conveyor with flowing sequence. The conveyor system consists of a continuous belt conveyor line involving conveyors U-1 to U-5 with a \r\ncommon length of 2937m.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZPtyV5WZcQns/isnzVuJHVOT1J2tPrOoJqrWs6NSsk0="},"bd03531a-58cb-4a01-810d-7f1039cc831c":{"id_":"bd03531a-58cb-4a01-810d-7f1039cc831c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"PVbzZ+6sJDjg5OuZ37e5IlkU+4cEu/WgXF/1OqAMB1M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1f6f09f7-1390-46d2-92bf-b405065306fb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"ZPtyV5WZcQns/isnzVuJHVOT1J2tPrOoJqrWs6NSsk0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"41fa046f-dc22-4c83-be2c-f58f20bc4757","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"xwaYuRO/d7lRJ91Fv56E1gWx42qhKwRjbpbelrBAN/8="}},"text":"In the immediate vicinity of the crusher station, there is an operator cabin installed to control the handling \r\nprocess of the crushing station and the belt conveyor system.

It is the first drive in the conveying sequence and has a \r\ncapacity of three truck loads (two truck unloading ramps allow double unloading). During unloading operation, \r\nthe coal falls from the dump truck into a hopper at which base the apron feeder is situated. The material is \r\ntransported along a slope to the top point of the apron feeder where it is discharged into a further chute, which \r\nguides the coal directly into the crusher. Capacitive material detectors on the ground and on top report to the \r\ncontrol system if the chute is filled or free for a new truck unloading operation. The apron feeder consists basically of following main components: \r\nâ main frame, \r\nâ apron strand, \r\nâ driven tumbler, \r\nâ drive unit,  \r\nâ take-up unit, \r\nâ set of rollers, \r\nâ set of impact rails.

The impact \r\nrockers are arranged in a way so that the product is thrown back into the crushing radius. The output grain size can be determined and easily controlled from outside by adjusting the impact rockers, \r\nt.i., by altering the gap between the rotor and the impact rocker.

Tensioning and releasing of the tension is effected by three external take-up spindles. Drive unit and crusher have a fixed coupling via belt-drive. The motor and countershaft are connected via an \r\nelastic coupling. For that matter, the motor is energized via a frequency converter. Due to its volume, the \r\nrunning crusher has a high inertia torque and much kinetic energy. The FC allows a better and longer \r\ncontrolled start-up and shut-down after using. The start-up takes approx. 2 min. and the shut-down lasts \r\nabout 5 min. To detect any slipping between the drive unit and the crusher there are speed sensors installed on both sides. Both values will be compared to detect slipping before a different speed causes friction and heat to the V-\r\nbelts, which connect both sides - the motor and the machine.

station are used for transporting coal, mixed with xylitol, from a \r\nnearby open cast mining to an open air coal storage (not in scope of supply) inside a power plant. The entire equipment consists of two main components: \r\nï Crusher station for twin truck feeding, \r\nï Belt conveyor system with 1 line for feeding the power plant open air stockpiles. The crushing station is designed to feed an apron feeder by trucks from 2 sides. During unloading, trucks \r\ndump the coal-xylitol-mix through a hopper to the loading surface of the apron feeder. It starts and carries the \r\nmaterial along a slope to its top point and discharges the load into a chute with a running impact crusher \r\nbelow. Big lumps of coal and long pieces of xylitol are cracked inside the crusher immediately and the outgoing \r\nmaterial falls through a chute to the loading table of the first belt conveyor with flowing sequence. The continuous conveyor line consisting of conveyors U-1 to U-5 transports the material further to the \r\nsecondary crushing equipment. In the immediate vicinity of the crusher station, there is an operator cabin installed to control the handling \r\nprocess of the crushing station and the belt conveyor system. This cabin is designed for a continuous \r\npresence of an operator.

The conveyor system consists of a continuous belt \r\nconveyor line involving conveyors U-1 to U-5 with a capacity of 1000 t/h and common final length of approx. 2901 m. Almost at the end of the conveyor line, at the conveyor U-5, additional equipment is installed to check the \r\nincoming bulk material and to hold it clean. These are: \r\nï 1 magnetic separator, \r\nï 2 metal detectors before and after the separator and \r\nï 1 belt scale. The belt conveyors are the key drives for material handling. These drives are only switchable from the local \r\nrepair switch to enable the repair operation outside of interlocking. Further, each belt conveyor can be \r\nseparately locked in manual mode when the following conveyor is running. If all conditions are met, all \r\nconveyors in the conveying line in the semi-automatic operation start counter to the conveying direction and \r\nstop in the conveying direction. In the locked and semi-automatic operation, separate and independent switching of individual promoters \r\nwithin the line is not possible. The sequence described above is observed in all cases. In an emergency situation the system can be immediately shut-down by opening the emergency stop loop. This can be done by pulling a ripcord or by pressing a hardware red mushroom emergency stop button or a \r\nvirtual red mushroom emergency stop button on a monitor in the control room. The boot process is delayed by the respective start-warning time. The stop operation is also delayed as a function of the belt speed and the effective length of the upper belt \r\nrun to secure emptying of the conveyor in order to guarantee normal operation.

From the crushing station the crushed coal is transferred to \r\nthe belt conveyor U1 which transports the material further to the hopper of the belt conveyor U2. The conveyor U1 is a relocated conveyor with an elevating structure. Depending on the mining progress, it \r\ncan be shifted together with the semi-mobile crushing station. The belt conveyor U1 consists basically of the \r\nfollowing components: \r\nï· \r\nMain frame, \r\nï· \r\nDrive station with drive pulley, \r\nï· \r\nTake-up station with take-up pulley, \r\nï· \r\nFeeding hopper, \r\nï· \r\nDischarge box with chute and adjustable baffle plate, \r\nï· \r\nCarrying idler stations, conveyor belt and belt cleaners, \r\nï· \r\nSafety devices. 1.2.1.1 \r\nConveyor frame \r\nThe conveyor frame directing the conveyor belt between the drive station and the take-up station is designed \r\nas a welded and bolted steel framework construction. The steel construction rests in the rear part on a \r\npontoon. On the other side the frame is held by a support which is connected with the main frame via pins. At \r\nthe support bottom a pontoon is installed. Both pontoons are connected by an intermediate cross bar via pins. The rear pontoon has a centering and is thus located centrally under the crusher chute. The conveyor between the crusher chute and the discharge box is protected by guard covers. The conveyor is furnished with walkways which provide safe access to the components requiring regular \r\nmaintenance as well as in case if corresponding operational, service and inspection works are needed. Components which can endanger operation and maintenance personnel are equipped with effective and \r\neasily mount/dismountable protective devices/guards. 1.2.1.2 \r\nDrive station with discharge box \r\nThe drive station is located in the head part (heading section) of the U1.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"xWCd7/ear0Ri9Sd6vyGHKmlm7PxrpAmsSWq/pJq51vY="},"5efd7199-63ec-412a-8325-d320053d08b2":{"id_":"5efd7199-63ec-412a-8325-d320053d08b2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"PVbzZ+6sJDjg5OuZ37e5IlkU+4cEu/WgXF/1OqAMB1M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d59ef532-cb83-4a22-a74d-867f9d82b2bc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"xWCd7/ear0Ri9Sd6vyGHKmlm7PxrpAmsSWq/pJq51vY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ede99385-8d48-4d62-ad1d-2b0f6d07cd08","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"/B31qu8vGqMGMELev9/H/l74XGaLsVtmD/A1D7x8KiY="}},"text":"It includes a discharge pulley and a \r\ndischarge box which are mounted on the conveyor frame.

The pedestal bearings of the take-up pulley are fastened on the take-up sledge. When installing the belt, the sledge should be brought into a definite position depending on the take-up way \r\nand secured there. The necessary pre-tension of the conveyor belt is effected by a mechanical pre-stressing (note the belt sag!). If due to the belt elongation the belt tension changes, it must be corrected by the take-up spindles. Before the take-up pulley, an inside belt cleaner is installed. 1.2.1.4 \r\nFeeding box \r\nThe feeding box is located in the tail part (end section of U1) and is used for receiving of conveyed material \r\nfrom the crusher chute and spillage from the apron feeder. The feeding box is designed as a stable welded \r\nand bolted steel construction which rests on the steel substructure. The lateral walls of the hopper are lined with wear plates. The feeding box is sealed on both sides along the \r\nbelt by adjustable rubber strips. In the feeding zone, reinforced carrying idler stations are applied with idler spacing of 300 mm. The feeding \r\nidler stations are fastened by means of bolted connections. The rubber curtains mounted in the feeding hopper are intended to reduce dust emissions. The hopper is protected by covers. 1.2.1.5 \r\nPulleys \r\nThe drive pulley has herringbone rubber lining and is supported by pillow blocks with anti-friction bearings \r\nwith adapter sleeve. The shaft and pulley tube are connected by taperlock connections. The take-up pulley has plain rubber lining and is supported by pillow blocks with antifriction bearings with \r\nadapter sleeve.

The \r\nconveyor U2 carries the coal as far as the drive station and transfers it to the belt conveyor U3. The conveyor U2 is a relocated conveyor with an elevating structure. Depending on the mining progress, it \r\ncan be shifted together with the semi-mobile crushing station. The belt conveyor U2 consists basically of the \r\nfollowing components: \r\nï· \r\nConveyor frame, \r\nï· \r\nCombined drive and take-up station, \r\nï· \r\nReturn station, \r\nï· \r\nFeeding hopper, \r\nï· \r\nDischarge box with chute and adjustable baffle plate, \r\nï· \r\nCarrying idler garlands, conveyor belt and belt cleaners, \r\nï· \r\nSafety devices. 1.2.2.2 \r\nConveyor frame \r\nThe conveyor frame rests on steel sleepers and builds a connection between the return station and the \r\ncombined drive/take-up station. The conveyor consists of definite number of frame sections which results \r\nfrom the conveyor length. Each conveyor section includes four upper run garlands and two lower run garlands. The idler spacing in the \r\nupper run comprises 1,6 m and in the lower run 3,2 m. All conveyor sections have a system length of 6,4 m. Each section consists of two supports on which longitudinal stringers made from profile steel are mounted. The spacing between the supports makes 3,2 m. On the level of lower run garland suspension the supports \r\nare fastened to the frame construction by means of angles. The sleeper is also integrated in the supports of \r\nthe conveyor sections.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MfJIkaZCt+O6PdP3F/hboNsXNIG8N5RDPUGP5ykAhPg="},"67b085d0-ecc5-48f1-917d-50886e2c5f62":{"id_":"67b085d0-ecc5-48f1-917d-50886e2c5f62","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"PVbzZ+6sJDjg5OuZ37e5IlkU+4cEu/WgXF/1OqAMB1M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b1870d2a-3d40-4b74-ba00-e5b82ec6a233","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"MfJIkaZCt+O6PdP3F/hboNsXNIG8N5RDPUGP5ykAhPg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"683da1fd-9c64-464d-b6c3-9c03bc5b55c6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"le9/vGNR6V3SJbIJvkAIw948FyVI2o9pokAFlfk79XQ="}},"text":"The sleeper is also integrated in the supports of \r\nthe conveyor sections.

The sledge \r\nand the dead weight box are arranged vertically in lateral guide rails. The conveyor belt coming from the first deflection pulley is guided downwards to the take-up sledge where it \r\nwraps around the take-up pulley and runs again upwards to the second deflection pulley in the lower run of \r\nthe conveyor line. The guiding device of the take-up sledge is built by two longitudinal beams which are mounted on both sides \r\nof the conveyor bridge and fastened at the foot in concrete by means of anchor bolts. The take-up sledge is equipped with a V-shaped inside belt cleaner which is mounted on the take-up frame. The sledge and the dead weight box have lateral guiding elements intended for lateral stabilising during \r\nvertical movement. The pillow blocks of the take-up pulley are fastened in the take-up sledge. The take-up sledge and the dead \r\nweight box are bolted directly with each other. For repair and maintenance works, an auxiliary platform is provided at the height of 5,35 m. In its middle, the \r\nplatform has a through hole. The guiding rails are mounted laterally and the take-up sledge with the dead \r\nweight moves vertically through. The work platform is mounted sideways on two single supports. The other \r\nside of the platform is connected with the column 5 of the bridge. The platform is accessible via a walkway to \r\nthe column 5 and a ladder installed at the column. By reason of belt stretching and eventual movements during start-up and shutdown, the dead weight can \r\nmove in the vertical direction between the limit values. The travel path of the take-up sledge is controlled and \r\nsecured by limit switches.

Commissioning Program \r\n \r\n1.1 General \r\n \r\nThis Commissioning program is intended to describe step by step the commissioning activities and \r\ntests. It covers the period of time from mechanical completion right up to the Start-Up Procedures. Commissioning includes coordination of all individual activities (incl. those of the sub-suppliers) in \r\norder to provide production requirements and performance as contractually agreed to. All commissioning measures are allocated to the commissioning stages explained subsequently. The commissioning stages (fig. 1) contain the essential steps of preparation and execution of the \r\ncommissioning activities of all by FAM supplied equipments. In general the commissioning procedures are sub-divided into the following steps. - Pre-commissioning  \r\n- Commissioning (Functional and Interlocked Operation Test) without material \r\n- Commissioning with material \r\n \r\nThese steps include all settings, adjustments and functional tests to that allow operability of the \r\nplant to operate without and with material (as specified in contract documents). The system consist: \r\n \r\nï· Crusher Station for twin Truck feeding \r\nï· Belt conveyor system consists of a continuous belt conveyor line U-1 to U-5 (with Magnet-\r\nic separator, Metal detector and belt scale).

The Pre-Commissioning tests comprise all activities for testing the \r\nsystem controls. Before switching on (switch gear) for the first time, the contractor must submit the end of erection \r\nwork. The Pre-commissioning tests require component suppliers to be present for the electrical and con-\r\ntrol equipment review and checkout. 1.3 Commissioning without material \r\n \r\nThe purpose of the commissioning procedure is to make adjustments and assure that the equip-\r\nment are ready for Commissioning with material. The Commissioning procedures contain the fol-\r\nlowing two activities: \r\n- \r\nFunctional Tests \r\n- \r\nInterlocked Operation Test \r\n \r\n1.3.1 Functional Tests \r\n \r\nFunctional Tests are physical run tests of individual components without feed material. During the Functional Tests for example the following items are addressed: \r\n \r\nï· Check all bearings for temperature and assure proper and sufficient lubrication, \r\nï· Circulation control devices are checked for operation and sensitivity,  \r\nï· All limit switches are set and safety devices checked, \r\nï· Mechanical settings such as tensioning and aligning the conveyors are rechecked, \r\nï· Rotational direction of motors, power draw  \r\nï·  and temperature are checked.

The switching state remaining after the functional test âdisconnectedâ or âready for operationâ is \r\ndetermined in agreement with the client. Specific Lock-out-Procedures shall be arranged before \r\nstarting the tests. Carrying out of the Functional Tests and readiness for Interlocked Operation Tests must be rec-\r\norded. 1.3.2 Interlocked Operation Test \r\n \r\nThese tests are conducted without operating the facility with feed material.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AoH84hPDJWj5rUsXTWux8MRyGVOO2pTYNYxJ4MfTYcE="},"e239c752-1ad5-4eda-b212-d50b12dfeb0f":{"id_":"e239c752-1ad5-4eda-b212-d50b12dfeb0f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"PVbzZ+6sJDjg5OuZ37e5IlkU+4cEu/WgXF/1OqAMB1M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"79144b7b-9a33-4a40-b6dc-4bf6ade168e8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"AoH84hPDJWj5rUsXTWux8MRyGVOO2pTYNYxJ4MfTYcE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e8a00581-03a0-4193-9944-f42ac684f932","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"pPzfFDBGUbw2tPJxCLUAjSgpOxXlroGHK574548DL5E="}},"text":"These tests demonstrate the functionality of the equipment, including Start-Stop-sequences, inter-\r\nlocking and control and safety functions.
