OVERPRESSURE \r\nPrior  to repair  or  maintenance,  the  equipment  items  and  pressure  lines  to  be \r\nopened must be relieved from pressure. Work should be carried out only by skilled workers. WARNING \r\nCAUTION, HOT LIQUIDS AND VAPOURS \r\nBe careful when handling hot substances. Risk of skin burns and scalds. DANGER \r\n \r\nDANGER \r\n \r\nPOTENTIAL HAZARDS CAUSED BY ELECTRIC POWER \r\nPOTENTIAL RISK OF AUTOMATIC OR UNINTENDED START OF MACHINE \r\nOnly qualified electricians should carry out work on the power supply system. Make  sure  that  machine  and plant  equipment  subject  to  compulsory  inspections, \r\nrepair  and  maintenance  work  are  isolated  from  power  before  such work  is  carried \r\nout. To be sure, check the isolated equipment items if they  are still under voltage. Earth and short-circuit them and isolate other equipment in the vicinity from power \r\nsupply. Prior to all repair and erection work, the equipment and its components should be \r\nisolated from power supply so that drives cannot be started by mistake while repair \r\nwork is carried out. All  cable  connections  of  components  to  be  replaced  must  be  disconnected. After \r\nreassembly, cable connections must be made again! DANGER \r\nDANGER FOR THE DRIFT STABILITY \r\nSuitable  measures  must  be  taken  to  ensure  at  any  time  that  all  repair  and \r\nmaintenance work can be safely accomplished without impairing the stability of the \r\noverall  machine. If  brakes  are  removed,  additional  fixtures  (e.g. clamping  devices) \r\nmust be used that have the same effect. WARNING \r\nWARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES \r\nUtmost  care  is  required  when  suspending  or  threading-in  auxiliary  tools  for  lifting \r\nof loads (chains, lifting belts, ropes).

All repair work must be realized only at wind speeds up to maximum 5 m/s. During \r\nthe repairs, the wind speed must not exceed 10 m/s! DANGER \r\nDANGER DUE TO UNINTENDED RE-START! Prior to repair, the conveying routes affected and upstream conveyors of machines \r\nmust  be  made  empty. Suitable actions  are  required  to  ensure that  such  equipment \r\ncannot be started by mistake. Starting of  the  electrical  or  hydraulic  drives  of  the  assembly  groups  that are  being \r\nworked on, must be excluded. DANGER \r\nDANGER FOR THE STABILITY! In  case  repair  work  technology  makes  it  necessary  to erect  piles  between  ground \r\nlevel and machine, the load carrying capacity of soil must be calculated before the \r\npiles are erected (the permitted ground pressure need to be complied). The  piles  must be  erected  on  a  ground  level sufficiently  able  to  take the maximum \r\nload. The  size of  the  piles  must  be selected  according  to  the  permitted ground  pressure \r\nand the imposed load. The piles must be secured against overturning. In  this  process  need  to  be  ensured  that  the  piles  are  positioned  vertically  and \r\ncentrically under the support points. DANGER \r\nDANGER FOR THE STABILITY! In  case  of  using  mobile lifting  devices,  the  load  carrying  capacity  of  soil  must  be \r\ncalculated before (the permitted ground pressure need to be complied). DANGER \r\nDANGER DUE TO OBJECTS FALLING DOWN! For all repair works it is forbidden to stay under the repair area! This area has to be \r\nclosed off across a large area. Falling objects may cause severe bodily injury or loss of life.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"xqsfGpE1h8o5LoDh+Yh4ynhQslA90lyT5pRchfgk/44="},"fcce829e-afa6-48a8-a4ff-b0dc6130b5cb":{"id_":"fcce829e-afa6-48a8-a4ff-b0dc6130b5cb","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"ijYkgxT9LUZ9DmA/H2m9k55m40DBAlfnUgm/fXu3ME4="}},"text":"Project: Stanari                     Revision: 0 Project no.: 109794           Page:  9 of 62       File name: 109794_M6_CS_EN.docx \r\n \r\n \r\nDANGER \r\nWARNING! RISK OF INJURIES CAUSED BY SPRING TENSION/CHAIN TENSION! When installing or removing components under mechanical stresses, persons might \r\nsuffer injuries and equipment parts may become damaged or even destroyed. Before  performing  work  on  such  components  suitable  action  should  be  taken  to \r\nexclude such potential risks. DANGER \r\nRISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS \r\nThe conveying belt is always under tension, even while a belt conveyor is switched \r\noff.

All repair work must be realized only at wind speeds up to maximum 5 m/s. During \r\nthe repairs, the wind speed must not exceed 10 m/s! DANGER \r\nDANGER DUE TO UNINTENDED RE-START! Prior to repair, the conveying routes affected and upstream conveyors of machines \r\nmust be made empty. Suitable actions are required to ensure that such equipment \r\ncannot be started by mistake. Starting of the electrical or hydraulic drives of the assembly groups that are being \r\nworked on, must be excluded. DANGER \r\nDANGER FOR THE STABILITY! In case repair work technology makes it necessary to erect piles between ground \r\nlevel and machine, the load carrying capacity of soil must be calculated before the \r\npiles are erected (the permitted ground pressure need to be complied). The piles must be erected on a ground level sufficiently able to take the maximum \r\nload. The size of the piles must be selected according to the permitted ground pressure \r\nand the imposed load. The piles must be secured against overturning. In this process need to be ensured that the piles are positioned vertically and \r\ncentrically under the support points. DANGER \r\nDANGER FOR THE STABILITY! In case of using mobile lifting devices, the load carrying capacity of soil must be \r\ncalculated before (the permitted ground pressure need to be complied). DANGER \r\nDANGER DUE TO OBJECTS FALLING DOWN! For all repair works it is forbidden to stay under the repair area! This area has to be \r\nclosed off across a large area. Falling objects may cause severe bodily injury or loss of life.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vd6nrhYzzzyb/wggesE2Rg2LHG8sW78jBnWQKlfd9z8="},"a81b220b-7b32-40c1-9df0-08fa8c68b1f8":{"id_":"a81b220b-7b32-40c1-9df0-08fa8c68b1f8","metadata":{"page_number":70,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.pdf_70","metadata":{"page_number":70,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"O6FkUn7TD3Ua/7v/G1IfSqJzgqjFbBmB1/fkMPZDeoU="}},"text":"Project:   Stanari                  Revision: 0 Project no.: 109794         Page:  8 of 64      File name: 109794_M6_BC_EN.docx \r\n \r\n \r\nDANGER \r\nWARNING!

Belt misalignment can be caused by material accumulations on idlers or pulleys. Before carrying out further works, this must be checked. Material accumulations \r\nmust be removed. The straight running of the belt is influenced by the corresponding setting of the carrying idlers and pulleys. The following applies to carrying idlers: \r\nï The belt always runs to the side it meets first. The following applies in general: \r\nï Even small adjustment angles (Î±) cause lateral movements. ï The shifting (influencing) is effected slowly. The conveyor belt must be monitored for a longer period of time \r\nto ensure that it does not move to the opposite side. ï Slanted pulleys achieve significantly stronger effects and are therefore often the cause for misalignment. Therefore, only the correct alignment and straight position should be checked. Adjustment for the steering of \r\nthe belt should be avoided. ï Multi-part carrying idler stations are often equipped with a so-called camber of the two outer side rollers. In \r\nnormal position, these rollers are aligned symmetrically askew to the running direction of the belt. If such \r\nstations are installed in the wrong direction, they cause misalignment. The direction of installation must be \r\nchecked. ï Measures taken to eliminate misalignment must be recorded in order to have hints on possible causes for \r\nfuture problems so the initial condition can be restored.

DANGER \r\nRISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS \r\nThe conveying belt remains under stress even when the belt conveyor is switched \r\noff. In case of work when the conveyor belt exerts a direct or indirect effect, \r\npretension must be neutralized by relieving the conveyor belt before starting the \r\nwork. This might result in a short movement of the conveyor belt and the take-up \r\ndevice. ï If components of the tensioning device which affect the holding force, such as geared motor, cable drum \r\netc., are scheduled for disassembly, the conveyor belt must be relieved from tension before start of the \r\nrepair work, and the take-up carriage must be moved to the end position and secured against moving. The \r\nindividual components can then be disassembled after they have been attached to a suitable hoist and the \r\nappropriate fastening screws have been loosened. ï Installation of the components is realised in the reversed order. In this connection, particular attention must \r\nbe paid to the firm seating of the fastening elements.

coal,  mixed  with  xylitol,  from  a  nearby  open  cast \r\nmining to an open air coal storage (not in scope of supply) inside a power plant. The entire equipment consists of two main components: \r\nï Crusher station for twin truck feeding, \r\nï Belt conveyor system with 1 line for feeding the power plant open air stockpiles. The  crusher station  is  designed  to  feed an apron  feeder  by  trucks  from  2  sides. During  unloading, trucks \r\ndump the coal-xylitol-mix through a hopper to the loading surface of the apron feeder. It starts and carries the \r\nmaterial  along a slope  to  its  top  point  and discharges the  load  into  a  chute  with  a  running  impact  crusher \r\nbelow. Big  lumps  of  coal  and  long  pieces  of  xylitol are cracked  inside  the  crusher  immediately  and  the outgoing \r\nmaterial falls through a chute to the loading table of the first belt conveyor with flowing sequence. The  conveyor  system  consists  of  a continuous  belt  conveyor  line involving conveyors U-1  to  U-5 with  a \r\ncommon length of 2937m. In  the  immediate  vicinity  of the  crusher  station, there  is an  operator  cabin installed to  control  the  handling \r\nprocess  of  the  crushing station  and  the  belt  conveyor  system.

It  is  the  first  drive  in  the  conveying  sequence  and  has  a \r\ncapacity of three truck loads (two truck unloading ramps allow double unloading). During unloading operation, \r\nthe coal falls from the dump truck into a hopper at which base the apron feeder is situated. The material is \r\ntransported along a slope to the top point of the apron feeder where it is discharged into a further chute, which \r\nguides the coal directly into the crusher. Capacitive material detectors on the ground and on top report to the \r\ncontrol system if the chute is filled or free for a new truck unloading operation. The apron feeder consists basically of following main components: \r\nâ main frame, \r\nâ apron strand, \r\nâ driven tumbler, \r\nâ drive unit,  \r\nâ take-up unit, \r\nâ set of rollers, \r\nâ set of impact rails. 1.3.2 Main Frame \r\nAll components of the apron feeder are mounted on the main frame which is designed as a welded structure \r\nbuilt up by two longitudinal girders and numerous cross beams.

The pulling unit is formed by means of two track chains which \r\nare arranged in the double-link style. The individual aprons are fastened on the chain links. The gap between adjacent aprons is closed with a seal \r\nso that material cannot penetrate between the aprons even when moving around the sprocket wheels. The aprons are fabricated in welded design. The complete apron strand is guided in the upper run by means of rigidly fixed and maintenance-free track \r\nrollers. Below  the  apron strand, there  are  arranged  impact  rails  which absorb the loading impact  resulting \r\nfrom feeding operation. The return rollers are installed on both sides under the aprons. These rollers run on rails fitted to the carrying \r\nframe in the return strand. The chain is guided over a drive sprocket and a return sprocket. 1.3.4 Driven Tumbler \r\nThe driven tumbler is formed by a drive shaft with drive chain wheels and pillow blocks containing spherical \r\nroller bearings.

Rotating at high speed (ca. 39 m/sec), the rotor placed in a housing lined with wear plates grasps \r\nthe  feed  material with  great  force  and  throws  it  against  impact  rockers. The  impact  rockers with  oscillating \r\nsuspension are installed in the housing. The  feed  material  is  crushed  between  blow  bars  and  impact  rockers  to  the  desired  grain  size. The  impact \r\nrockers are arranged in a way so that the product is thrown back into the crushing radius. The output grain size can be determined and easily controlled from outside by adjusting the impact rockers, \r\nt.i., by altering the gap between the rotor and the impact rocker. Besides, the contact pressure can be changed by respective tensioning of the helical compression springs. The crushed material  falls  without  time  delay  through the third  chute onto the belt  conveyor  U-1 installed \r\nbelow the chute.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7LBhpemRkgNqwntICpktdd4/1FRXbe7r/jXjRSCGk04="},"cf32fbc0-d73d-475e-9bd8-c8a618facead":{"id_":"cf32fbc0-d73d-475e-9bd8-c8a618facead","metadata":{"page_number":165,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.pdf_165","metadata":{"page_number":165,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"TjPxnY8Z6c+hg/OP15n/YsbsG92AadNqoCVp/v3XeGU="}},"text":"Project: Stanari                    Revision: 0 Project no.: 109794           Page: 12 of 12       File name: 109794_M4_CS_EN.docx \r\n \r\n1.5.2 Drive Unit \r\nThe impact crusher is driven by a narrow V-belt drive consisting of 18 V-belts 8V/25N with a pitch length of \r\n12700 mm. Tensioning and releasing of the tension is effected by three external take-up spindles. Drive unit and crusher have a fixed coupling via belt-drive. The motor and countershaft are connected via an \r\nelastic  coupling. For  that  matter, the  motor is energized  via  a  frequency  converter. Due  to  its  volume, the \r\nrunning  crusher has a  high inertia  torque and  much  kinetic  energy. The FC  allows  a  better  and  longer \r\ncontrolled  start-up  and  shut-down  after  using. The  start-up  takes  approx. 2 min. and  the  shut-down lasts \r\nabout 5 min. To detect any slipping between the drive unit and the crusher there are speed sensors installed on both sides. Both  values  will  be  compared to  detect  slipping  before  a  different  speed causes  friction  and  heat  to  the  V-\r\nbelts, which connect both sides - the motor and the machine. 1.5.3 Hydraulic System \r\nThe impact crusher is furnished with two hydraulic cylinders for the housing opening device. The cylinders of \r\nthe machine are supplied by one hydraulic unit with which they are connected via pipe and hose lines. The cylinder pair is provided with a 4/3 directional valve on the hydraulic unit to actuate opening and closing \r\noperation of the crusher housing. Each  cylinder  is  equipped  with  a  load-holding  valve  to  keep  the  cylinder  in  position  and  protect  it  against

for transporting coal,  mixed  with  xylitol,  from  a \r\nnearby open cast mining to an open air coal storage (not in scope of supply) inside a power plant. The entire equipment consists of two main components: \r\nï Crusher station for twin truck feeding, \r\nï Belt conveyor system with 1 line for feeding the power plant open air stockpiles. The  crushing station  is  designed  to  feed  an  apron  feeder  by  trucks from  2  sides. During  unloading, trucks \r\ndump the coal-xylitol-mix through a hopper to the loading surface of the apron feeder. It starts and carries the \r\nmaterial  along a slope  to  its  top  point  and discharges the  load  into  a  chute  with  a  running  impact  crusher \r\nbelow. Big  lumps  of  coal  and  long  pieces  of  xylitol are cracked  inside  the  crusher  immediately  and  the outgoing \r\nmaterial falls through a chute to the loading table of the first belt conveyor with flowing sequence. The continuous conveyor line consisting of  conveyors  U-1  to  U-5 transports  the  material  further  to  the \r\nsecondary crushing equipment. In  the  immediate  vicinity  of the  crusher  station, there  is an  operator  cabin installed to  control  the  handling \r\nprocess  of  the  crushing station  and  the  belt  conveyor  system. This  cabin  is  designed  for  a  continuous \r\npresence of an operator.

The  conveyor  system  consists  of  a continuous  belt \r\nconveyor line involving conveyors U-1 to U-5 with a capacity of 1000 t/h and common final length of approx. 2901 m. Almost at the  end  of  the  conveyor  line,  at the conveyor  U-5, additional  equipment is installed  to  check  the \r\nincoming bulk material and to hold it clean. These are: \r\nï 1 magnetic separator, \r\nï 2 metal detectors before and after the separator and \r\nï 1 belt scale. The belt conveyors are the key drives for material handling. These drives are only switchable from the local \r\nrepair switch to enable the  repair operation outside of interlocking. Further, each belt  conveyor can be \r\nseparately locked in manual mode when  the  following conveyor is  running. If  all  conditions are  met, all \r\nconveyors in the conveying line in the semi-automatic operation start counter to the conveying direction and \r\nstop in the conveying direction. In  the  locked and semi-automatic  operation,  separate and independent  switching  of individual promoters \r\nwithin the line is not possible. The sequence described above is observed in all cases. In  an  emergency  situation the  system can be immediately  shut-down by opening the emergency  stop  loop. This can be done by pulling a ripcord or by pressing a hardware red mushroom emergency stop button or a \r\nvirtual red mushroom emergency stop button on a monitor in the control room. The boot process is delayed by the respective start-warning time. The stop operation is also delayed as a function of the belt speed and the effective length of the upper belt \r\nrun to secure emptying of the conveyor in order to guarantee normal operation.

From the crushing station the crushed coal is transferred to \r\nthe belt conveyor U1 which transports the material further to the hopper of the belt conveyor U2. The  conveyor  U1  is  a  relocated conveyor  with  an  elevating  structure. Depending  on  the mining  progress, it \r\ncan be shifted together with the semi-mobile crushing station. The belt conveyor U1 consists basically of the \r\nfollowing components: \r\nï· Main frame, \r\nï· Drive station with drive pulley, \r\nï· Take-up station with take-up pulley, \r\nï· Feeding hopper, \r\nï· Discharge box with chute and adjustable baffle plate, \r\nï· Carrying idler stations, conveyor belt and belt cleaners, \r\nï· Safety devices. 1.2.1.1 Conveyor frame \r\nThe conveyor frame directing the conveyor belt between the drive station and the take-up station is designed \r\nas a  welded  and  bolted  steel framework construction. The  steel  construction  rests in  the  rear  part  on  a \r\npontoon. On the other side the frame is held by a support which is connected with the main frame via pins. At \r\nthe support bottom a pontoon is installed. Both pontoons are connected by an intermediate cross bar via pins. The rear pontoon has a centering and is thus located centrally under the crusher chute. The conveyor between the crusher chute and the discharge box is protected by guard covers. The  conveyor  is  furnished  with  walkways  which  provide  safe  access  to  the  components  requiring  regular \r\nmaintenance as well as in case if corresponding operational, service and inspection works are needed. Components  which  can  endanger  operation  and  maintenance  personnel  are  equipped  with  effective  and \r\neasily mount/dismountable protective devices/guards.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5M1AXLHZwvTp5DYlkHFQPEmlOL2e8hYMcZLwZG1ZszI="},"2d35dbc8-8a69-49f2-a251-2cf75adf5522":{"id_":"2d35dbc8-8a69-49f2-a251-2cf75adf5522","metadata":{"page_number":171,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.pdf_171","metadata":{"page_number":171,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"xfYeDDXLbbTtMmcoaxhG2wdPC7rvnj04k88O+PDZXJw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d60940eb-4177-4645-ab4a-fd65a879fb74","metadata":{"page_number":171,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"5M1AXLHZwvTp5DYlkHFQPEmlOL2e8hYMcZLwZG1ZszI="}},"text":"1.2.1.2 Drive station with discharge box \r\nThe drive station is located in the head part (heading section) of the U1.

The  conveyor  belt  coming  from  the  drive  pulley  is  guided  in  the  lower  run \r\nover  carrying  idler  stations  to  the  take-up sledge. The  necessary  belt pre-tension  is reached  by  shifting  the \r\ntake-up sledge with the pulley by means of the spindles and spindle nuts. The sledge and  the  take-up  spindles  are  installed  in  the  steel  construction. The tension way  is  built  by  two \r\nlongitudinal beams which are welded to the frame on both sides. Lift-off restraints hold the take-up sledge on \r\nthe longitudinal beams. The pedestal bearings of the take-up pulley are fastened on the take-up sledge. When installing the belt, the sledge should be brought into a definite position depending on the take-up way \r\nand secured there. The necessary pre-tension of the conveyor belt is effected by a mechanical pre-stressing (note the belt sag!). If due to the belt elongation the belt tension changes, it must be corrected by the take-up spindles. Before the take-up pulley, an inside belt cleaner is installed. 1.2.1.4 Feeding box \r\nThe feeding box is located in the tail part (end section of U1) and is used for receiving of conveyed material \r\nfrom the crusher chute and spillage from the apron feeder. The feeding box is designed as a stable welded \r\nand bolted steel construction which rests on the steel substructure. The lateral walls of the hopper are lined with wear plates. The feeding box is sealed on both sides along the \r\nbelt by adjustable rubber strips. In the feeding zone, reinforced carrying idler stations are applied with idler spacing of 300 mm. The feeding \r\nidler stations are fastened by means of bolted connections.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"t8BChh/vBNXqR2o0blf+YPbJRwUl2WwwWGuF3eT7RzA="},"887fa13e-f1fc-4fc6-95b2-a7fc3325717e":{"id_":"887fa13e-f1fc-4fc6-95b2-a7fc3325717e","metadata":{"page_number":172,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.pdf_172","metadata":{"page_number":172,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"10LTOiuPOAr4plOYiSAhr0jXjhRKZtcdl4dJsZ+PTaM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2092a1d5-e596-4562-9877-05e58d9e4fd0","metadata":{"page_number":172,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"t8BChh/vBNXqR2o0blf+YPbJRwUl2WwwWGuF3eT7RzA="}},"text":"The feeding \r\nidler stations are fastened by means of bolted connections.

It  is a  weight-operated  tensioning \r\nstation which consists of a take-up sledge, a dead weight box with ballast and a take-up pulley. The sledge \r\nand the dead weight box are arranged vertically in lateral guide rails. The conveyor belt coming from the first deflection pulley is guided downwards to the take-up sledge where it \r\nwraps around the take-up pulley and runs again upwards to the second deflection pulley in the lower run of \r\nthe conveyor line. The guiding device of the take-up sledge is built by two longitudinal beams which are mounted on both sides \r\nof the conveyor bridge and fastened at the foot in concrete by means of anchor bolts. The take-up sledge is equipped with a V-shaped inside belt cleaner which is mounted on the take-up frame. The  sledge  and  the  dead  weight  box  have  lateral  guiding  elements  intended  for  lateral  stabilising  during \r\nvertical movement. The pillow blocks of the take-up pulley are fastened in the take-up sledge. The take-up sledge and the dead \r\nweight box are bolted directly with each other. For repair and maintenance works, an auxiliary platform is provided at the height of 5,35 m. In its middle, the \r\nplatform  has  a  through  hole. The  guiding  rails  are  mounted  laterally  and  the  take-up  sledge  with  the  dead \r\nweight moves  vertically  through. The  work platform  is  mounted  sideways on  two single supports. The  other \r\nside of the platform is connected with the column 5 of the bridge. The platform is accessible via a walkway to \r\nthe column 5 and a ladder installed at the column. By  reason  of  belt  stretching  and  eventual  movements  during  start-up  and  shutdown,  the  dead  weight  can \r\nmove in the vertical direction between the limit values. The travel path of the take-up sledge is controlled and \r\nsecured by limit switches.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"r26FtwwG9OZBRL8tEDn+S0u8JMSqIQlNF2TtKjmIznc="},"32fa0d3d-3bdc-47b3-8ee0-3e0b3e27c9e4":{"id_":"32fa0d3d-3bdc-47b3-8ee0-3e0b3e27c9e4","metadata":{"page_number":188,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.pdf_188","metadata":{"page_number":188,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"XerJhx/zAd9x7VQiyPyGp0XF1uT3+6xt8uBruW8xBm0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"085fb0ca-10af-4b51-b9a0-4bde5a55c017","metadata":{"page_number":188,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"2s6VHNFy0URmhv6oK7AbglzkG8eOTUIPGT0/4Zg3Vek="}},"text":"Project: Stanari                   Revision: 0 Project no.: 109794          Page: 23 of 25       File name: 109794_M4_BC_EN_.docx \r\n \r\n1.2.5.5 Return station with feeding hopper \r\nThe return station with the feeding hopper is installed on an inclined concrete surface with anchor bolts.

In case of detection of metal parts in the material flow, the metal detector stops the belt conveyor. The  metal  detector  is  composed  of  a  frame  with  a  search  coil. The  metal  detector  generates  an \r\nelectromagnetic  field. If  a  metal  object  enters  the  field,  the  measurement  signal  is  deflected  in  a  certain \r\ndirection. When  the  metal  object  leaves  the field,  a  deflection  occurs  in  the  opposite  direction. If  both \r\ntriggering limits of the signal are exceeded, the metal relay is switched. An electronic circuit with an adjustable trigger enables the detection and display of metal elements.

In cases of emergency the equipment can be turned off by means of emergency switches with relevant pull \r\ncords installed on both sides of the conveyor line. Actuation of the pull rope triggers immediately standstill of \r\nthe conveyor and of the technologically interconnected conveying devices. Visual and acoustic start-up signals are provided by a warning lamp and a horn. Safety and warning devices include also: \r\nâ Limit switches for take-up way limit, \r\nâ Misalignment switch, \r\nâ Speed sensor and/or slip controller, \r\nâ Belt damage control, \r\nâ Filling level sensor of hopper, \r\nâ Supplying of LED-lamps for the entire conveyor.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fxi7TqGvTCcsgfHSEmRbpVw8sW0jYR6jdov1jEWKUV0="},"25a6094d-2696-4207-947d-6489eb6845ff":{"id_":"25a6094d-2696-4207-947d-6489eb6845ff","metadata":{"page_number":191,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.pdf_191","metadata":{"page_number":191,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"6kvd5cFsnvQyx5Ey8qis2UtC4cjieC3gvQC+XSqP5XM="}},"text":"Projekt:          EFT Stanari                                                                             \r\nProjekt-Nr.: 109794                                                                                  \r\nClient:      EFT â Rudnik I Termoelektrana Stanari D.O.O.

Commissioning Program \r\n \r\n1.1 General \r\n \r\nThis Commissioning program is intended to describe step by step the commissioning activities and \r\ntests. It covers the period of time from mechanical completion right up to the Start-Up Procedures. Commissioning includes coordination of all individual activities (incl. those of the sub-suppliers) in \r\norder to provide production requirements and performance as contractually agreed to. All commissioning measures are allocated to the commissioning stages explained subsequently. The commissioning stages (fig. 1) contain the essential steps of preparation and execution of the \r\ncommissioning activities of all by FAM supplied equipments. In general the commissioning procedures are sub-divided into the following steps. - Pre-commissioning  \r\n- Commissioning (Functional and Interlocked Operation Test) without material \r\n- Commissioning with material \r\n \r\nThese steps include all settings, adjustments and functional tests to that allow operability of the \r\nplant to operate without and with material (as specified in contract documents). The system consist: \r\n \r\nï·   Crusher Station for twin Truck feeding \r\nï·   Belt conveyor system consists of a continuous belt conveyor line U-1 to U-5 (with Magnet-\r\nic separator, Metal detector and belt scale).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"P9kQScT+FODZZKc9THMZlVmmqKjn7LcEg2gNSsizS2c="},"8c98e20b-da8f-4746-9dd5-59227443f330":{"id_":"8c98e20b-da8f-4746-9dd5-59227443f330","metadata":{"page_number":194,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.pdf_194","metadata":{"page_number":194,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"lpqpGpOqjUk6fdNEEr2MIoEpGxPriwoe/ztVP5wXHl8="}},"text":"EFT Stanari109794 \r\nCrusher station & belt conveying system \r\nCommissioning Program                                           \r\n Projekt: EFT Stanari                                                                    Rev. 0 \r\nProjekt-Nr.: 109794                                                                                                                                                                                              19.02.2015 \r\n \r\n   Fig. 1: Commissioning steps\r\nCommissioning\r\n(without material)\r\nFunctional Test\r\nof individual equipment \r\nand instruments\r\nTest\r\nof the interlocked operation\r\nPre-Commissioning\r\nCommissioning\r\n      (with material)         \r\nMechanical and \r\nElectrical \r\nCompletion\r\nCommissioning Procedure\r\nStart up of equipment with \r\nmaterial","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TTNLNzKRFmEGMZfgDGpNB5iz3hYp5KA/o2tn57siTOY="},"466fcbac-b2d7-4478-9dd5-f3c41eb77e6e":{"id_":"466fcbac-b2d7-4478-9dd5-f3c41eb77e6e","metadata":{"page_number":195,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.pdf_195","metadata":{"page_number":195,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"rIFghOQS/H+y6CjWBLL1YW0MiTnHq+zijUDNXh9qq5s="}},"text":"EFT Stanari109794 \r\nCrusher station & belt conveying system \r\nCommissioning Program                                           \r\n Projekt: EFT Stanari                                                                    Rev. 0 \r\nProjekt-Nr.: 109794                                                                                                                                                                                              19.02.2015 \r\n \r\n1.2 Pre-commissioning \r\n \r\nThe Pre-commissioning activities begin, as a rule, only after mechanical, electrical and control \r\ncompletion of the equipment. The Pre-Commissioning tests comprise all activities for testing the \r\nsystem controls. Before switching on (switch gear) for the first time, the contractor must submit the end of erection \r\nwork. The Pre-commissioning tests require component suppliers to be present for the electrical and con-\r\ntrol equipment review and checkout. 1.3   Commissioning without material \r\n \r\nThe purpose of the commissioning procedure is to make adjustments and assure that the equip-\r\nment are ready for Commissioning with material. The Commissioning procedures contain the fol-\r\nlowing two activities: \r\n- Functional Tests \r\n-     Interlocked Operation Test \r\n \r\n1.3.1 Functional Tests \r\n \r\nFunctional Tests are physical run tests of individual components without feed material. During the Functional Tests for example the following items are addressed: \r\n \r\nï·   Check all bearings for temperature and assure proper and sufficient lubrication, \r\nï·   Circulation control devices are checked for operation and sensitivity,  \r\nï·   All limit switches are set and safety devices checked, \r\nï·   Mechanical settings such as tensioning and aligning the conveyors are rechecked, \r\nï·   Rotational direction of motors, power draw   \r\nï·    and temperature are checked.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vayYZ1AHDaFU0wDu4djKzLdAb75ywNMmLEx2nNK/hrk="},"5c0dcbb1-9a70-4556-ab52-a09de6601cba":{"id_":"5c0dcbb1-9a70-4556-ab52-a09de6601cba","metadata":{"page_number":196,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.pdf_196","metadata":{"page_number":196,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.pdf","file_name":"FAM.pdf"},"hash":"LZ6oqk/PAsCI9Xe43fprLcyNCURn7FkpFcJ+L14deqI="}},"text":"EFT Stanari109794 \r\nCrusher station & belt conveying system \r\nCommissioning Program                                           \r\n Projekt: EFT Stanari                                                                    Rev. 0 \r\nProjekt-Nr.: 109794                                                                                                                                                                                              19.02.2015 \r\n \r\nSpecification, Sensor List and List of Power Consumption (Motor List) will form the basis for the \r\nFunctional Tests.

Specific Lock-out-Procedures shall be arranged before \r\nstarting the tests. Carrying out of the Functional Tests and readiness for Interlocked Operation Tests must be rec-\r\norded. 1.3.2   Interlocked Operation Test \r\n \r\nThese tests are conducted without operating the facility with feed material. These tests demonstrate the functionality of the equipment, including Start-Stop-sequences, inter-\r\nlocking and control and safety functions. For the equipment, this covers the entire system tests \r\nrequired prior the introduction of product. During the Testing, for example the following checks are carried out and operating possibilities are \r\nchecked: \r\n \r\nï·   Functioning of the individual devices/control systems in interlocked operation, \r\nï·   Starting up and shutting down procedures including interlocks and permissives, \r\nï·   âEmergency-Stopâ and starting up after âEmergency-Stopâ, \r\nï·   Switching on and off interlockings of all operating possibilities, \r\nï·   Functioning of the safety devices during starting up and shutting down as well as in the \r\ncase of malfunction changeovers, \r\nï·   Intended and actual parameters in interlocked operation.

an open air coal storage (not in scope of supply) inside a power plant. The entire equipment consists of two main components: \nï Crusher station for twin truck feeding, \nï Belt conveyor system with 1 line for feeding the power plant open air stockpiles. The crusher station is designed to feed an apron feeder by trucks from 2 sides. During unloading, trucks \ndump the coal-xylitol-mix through a hopper to the loading surface of the apron feeder. It starts and carries the \nmaterial along a slope to its top point and discharges the load into a chute with a running impact crusher \nbelow. Big lumps of coal and long pieces of xylitol are cracked inside the crusher immediately and the outgoing \nmaterial falls through a chute to the loading table of the first belt conveyor with flowing sequence. The conveyor system consists of a continuous belt conveyor line involving conveyors U-1 to U-5 with a \ncommon length of 2937m.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Ws3k9fnl8sbQvFz8yruJVPUEKDf0XgB68CwVWzaRGqE="},"a4f297ce-8a43-4a51-b543-af43e9f7aa25":{"id_":"a4f297ce-8a43-4a51-b543-af43e9f7aa25","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1c544203-5226-48e7-8127-14bbba77717e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"Ws3k9fnl8sbQvFz8yruJVPUEKDf0XgB68CwVWzaRGqE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6f158c73-3383-4231-98ee-98dd511afcfe","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"rOwQdoJCT5PYLlsR9cjpItuTRKAMNAYDEm1LaZvNgBY="}},"text":"In the immediate vicinity of the crusher station, there is an operator cabin installed to control the handling \nprocess of the crushing station and the belt conveyor system.

It is the first drive in the conveying sequence and has a \ncapacity of three truck loads (two truck unloading ramps allow double unloading). During unloading operation, \nthe coal falls from the dump truck into a hopper at which base the apron feeder is situated. The material is \ntransported along a slope to the top point of the apron feeder where it is discharged into a further chute, which \nguides the coal directly into the crusher. Capacitive material detectors on the ground and on top report to the \ncontrol system if the chute is filled or free for a new truck unloading operation. The apron feeder consists basically of following main components: \nâ main frame, \nâ apron strand, \nâ driven tumbler, \nâ drive unit,  \nâ take-up unit, \nâ set of rollers, \nâ set of impact rails.

The pulling unit is formed by means of two track chains which \nare arranged in the double-link style. The individual aprons are fastened on the chain links. The gap between adjacent aprons is closed with a seal \nso that material cannot penetrate between the aprons even when moving around the sprocket wheels. The aprons are fabricated in welded design. The complete apron strand is guided in the upper run by means of rigidly fixed and maintenance-free track \nrollers. Below the apron strand, there are arranged impact rails which absorb the loading impact resulting \nfrom feeding operation. The return rollers are installed on both sides under the aprons. These rollers run on rails fitted to the carrying \nframe in the return strand. The chain is guided over a drive sprocket and a return sprocket.

Rotating at high speed (ca. 39 m/sec), the rotor placed in a housing lined with wear plates grasps \nthe feed material with great force and throws it against impact rockers. The impact rockers with oscillating \nsuspension are installed in the housing. The feed material is crushed between blow bars and impact rockers to the desired grain size. The impact \nrockers are arranged in a way so that the product is thrown back into the crushing radius. The output grain size can be determined and easily controlled from outside by adjusting the impact rockers, \nt.i., by altering the gap between the rotor and the impact rocker. Besides, the contact pressure can be changed by respective tensioning of the helical compression springs. The crushed material falls without time delay through the third chute onto the belt conveyor U-1 installed \nbelow the chute.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AW8JMQzn+Yt5ybYH0wgDffBwDL9iXhgWSOISQfu2HbM="},"1b10afa8-fc1d-420e-ae74-9653eb1c1aa4":{"id_":"1b10afa8-fc1d-420e-ae74-9653eb1c1aa4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"052d3663-6d21-4cac-9d7f-09ba655b51da","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"AW8JMQzn+Yt5ybYH0wgDffBwDL9iXhgWSOISQfu2HbM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3d6e3b88-6ef3-4250-9ab6-212fb0996016","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"hSpkwMIzCZedgT2/dr+bam0McbqVZ8cNT+u5+lMu2sY="}},"text":"[Figure 1 - Impact Crusher PB 1822 PP - http://imeddata.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-crushed-material-falls-without-time-delay-through-the-third-chute-onto-the-belt-conveyor-U-1-installed-below-the-chute.png]\n\n[Figure 2 at center of the page]\n\n\nPage 165:\n \nProject: \nStanari  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevision: \n0 \nProject no.: 109794  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage: 12 of 12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFile name: \n109794_M4_CS_EN.docx \n \n1.5.2 Drive Unit \nThe impact crusher is driven by a narrow V-belt drive consisting of 18 V-belts 8V/25N with a pitch length of \n12700 mm. Tensioning and releasing of the tension is effected by three external take-up spindles. Drive unit and crusher have a fixed coupling via belt-drive. The motor and countershaft are connected via an \nelastic coupling. For that matter, the motor is energized via a frequency converter. Due to its volume, the \nrunning crusher has a high inertia torque and much kinetic energy. The FC allows a better and longer \ncontrolled start-up and shut-down after using. The start-up takes approx. 2 min. and the shut-down lasts \nabout 5 min. To detect any slipping between the drive unit and the crusher there are speed sensors installed on both sides. Both values will be compared to detect slipping before a different speed causes friction and heat to the V-\nbelts, which connect both sides - the motor and the machine.

\nDESIGN AND FUNCTION \n1.1 \nGeneral description \nThe belt conveying system with a crushing station are used for transporting coal, mixed with xylitol, from a \nnearby open cast mining to an open air coal storage (not in scope of supply) inside a power plant. The entire equipment consists of two main components: \nï Crusher station for twin truck feeding, \nï Belt conveyor system with 1 line for feeding the power plant open air stockpiles. The crushing station is designed to feed an apron feeder by trucks from 2 sides. During unloading, trucks \ndump the coal-xylitol-mix through a hopper to the loading surface of the apron feeder. It starts and carries the \nmaterial along a slope to its top point and discharges the load into a chute with a running impact crusher \nbelow. Big lumps of coal and long pieces of xylitol are cracked inside the crusher immediately and the outgoing \nmaterial falls through a chute to the loading table of the first belt conveyor with flowing sequence. The continuous conveyor line consisting of conveyors U-1 to U-5 transports the material further to the \nsecondary crushing equipment. In the immediate vicinity of the crusher station, there is an operator cabin installed to control the handling \nprocess of the crushing station and the belt conveyor system. This cabin is designed for a continuous \npresence of an operator.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vfGnO1iHPdxob7sa3WI0yB53JdDPUP0bAvzF8rUWeec="},"b307f5ff-202a-4ab2-abff-7e44ccb77d6f":{"id_":"b307f5ff-202a-4ab2-abff-7e44ccb77d6f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3483a22d-107b-457a-9c7a-3e5a6531d35d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"vfGnO1iHPdxob7sa3WI0yB53JdDPUP0bAvzF8rUWeec="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e7a84068-b93e-4e88-b509-7c8d8d6b2655","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"jWNXqGS+ILTe0e++jCmlieNb+RGZ6rsSJSP9BriO3DU="}},"text":"This cabin is designed for a continuous \npresence of an operator.

The conveyor system consists of a continuous belt \nconveyor line involving conveyors U-1 to U-5 with a capacity of 1000 t/h and common final length of approx. 2901 m. Almost at the end of the conveyor line, at the conveyor U-5, additional equipment is installed to check the \nincoming bulk material and to hold it clean. These are: \nï 1 magnetic separator, \nï 2 metal detectors before and after the separator and \nï 1 belt scale. The belt conveyors are the key drives for material handling. These drives are only switchable from the local \nrepair switch to enable the repair operation outside of interlocking. Further, each belt conveyor can be \nseparately locked in manual mode when the following conveyor is running. If all conditions are met, all \nconveyors in the conveying line in the semi-automatic operation start counter to the conveying direction and \nstop in the conveying direction. In the locked and semi-automatic operation, separate and independent switching of individual promoters \nwithin the line is not possible. The sequence described above is observed in all cases. In an emergency situation the system can be immediately shut-down by opening the emergency stop loop. This can be done by pulling a ripcord or by pressing a hardware red mushroom emergency stop button or a \nvirtual red mushroom emergency stop button on a monitor in the control room. The boot process is delayed by the respective start-warning time.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mNrSMckGHYlnJNwtggGv/HsdkRiH7y5696ezSseqqW8="},"e7a84068-b93e-4e88-b509-7c8d8d6b2655":{"id_":"e7a84068-b93e-4e88-b509-7c8d8d6b2655","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b307f5ff-202a-4ab2-abff-7e44ccb77d6f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"mNrSMckGHYlnJNwtggGv/HsdkRiH7y5696ezSseqqW8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2180da32-c7b7-4187-bee1-9468b5eea656","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"HAu2RpMpBdKUWmHKMfg/MMmYVn4LRlPl1+Eip/JSxmA="}},"text":"The boot process is delayed by the respective start-warning time.

The conveyor belt coming from the drive pulley is guided in the lower run \nover carrying idler stations to the take-up sledge. The necessary belt pre-tension is reached by shifting the \ntake-up sledge with the pulley by means of the spindles and spindle nuts. The sledge and the take-up spindles are installed in the steel construction. The tension way is built by two \nlongitudinal beams which are welded to the frame on both sides. Lift-off restraints hold the take-up sledge on \nthe longitudinal beams. The pedestal bearings of the take-up pulley are fastened on the take-up sledge. When installing the belt, the sledge should be brought into a definite position depending on the take-up way \nand secured there. The necessary pre-tension of the conveyor belt is effected by a mechanical pre-stressing (note the belt sag!). If due to the belt elongation the belt tension changes, it must be corrected by the take-up spindles. Before the take-up pulley, an inside belt cleaner is installed. 1.2.1.4 \nFeeding box \nThe feeding box is located in the tail part (end section of U1) and is used for receiving of conveyed material \nfrom the crusher chute and spillage from the apron feeder.

The conveyor consists of definite number of frame sections which results \nfrom the conveyor length. Each conveyor section includes four upper run garlands and two lower run garlands. The idler spacing in the \nupper run comprises 1,6 m and in the lower run 3,2 m. All conveyor sections have a system length of 6,4 m. Each section consists of two supports on which longitudinal stringers made from profile steel are mounted. The spacing between the supports makes 3,2 m. On the level of lower run garland suspension the supports \nare fastened to the frame construction by means of angles. The sleeper is also integrated in the supports of \nthe conveyor sections. The textile conveyor belt is supported in the upper run by three-piece garland stations and in the lower run by \ntwo-piece garland stations with rubber disc idlers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yeVybZXycjg+8LwwUTYCnnmdmh2vdGHi7sONMPogHSo="},"af229360-f918-42ff-9be9-fde66797e13a":{"id_":"af229360-f918-42ff-9be9-fde66797e13a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"88b8b35d-1e06-40e5-bb51-9328c66f8f25","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"yeVybZXycjg+8LwwUTYCnnmdmh2vdGHi7sONMPogHSo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"473b0b60-610a-4b03-a7ce-9696c8450cbf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"+5EDmpH+SXM/zY7scGuK3FIEIj5j5J7F5gbBcWhWIII="}},"text":"The entire conveyor frame is equipped with cable hooks \nand segmental arch covers.

The load \ncell determines the weight of the load on a certain belt section (1 m), and the speed transducer measures the \nbelt speed. The product of the two measured variables results in the current feed rate in t/h. The data \nprovided are passed over to the existing interface of the PLC for further evaluation. The belt weigher is fastened on the stringers of the conveyor frame and equipped in the upper run with two 3-\npiece idler stations for weight acquisition. The belt weigher is installed in the first frame section of the \nconveyor line which is located at the beginning of the conveyor bridge.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hF0WC3TYYVySBbGpcdNosruQG0tgsRbsSbRRjZzdb8g="},"fce1905c-7222-4b7a-8e50-dd927f6d4a8c":{"id_":"fce1905c-7222-4b7a-8e50-dd927f6d4a8c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/FAM.txt_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"EAZZn2pCLsnPjWn/pJlPPUot8jM51QzS3GikDZUITEg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"49336a46-72d8-4ab7-b84c-85a617feb1f5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"hF0WC3TYYVySBbGpcdNosruQG0tgsRbsSbRRjZzdb8g="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1d39b2ba-88a5-408b-af6e-b873b224b970","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Felipe LM\\Documents\\GitHub\\llama3-app\\llama3\\data\\FAM.txt","file_name":"FAM.txt"},"hash":"klG2mbZ5eN924JZA5uvkmYFbQB+5LDoSoqIwDFpv28Y="}},"text":"[Figure 1 at center of the page]\n\n\nPage 190:\n \nProject: \nStanari  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevision: \n0 \nProject no.: 109794  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage: 25 of 25 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFile name: \n109794_M4_BC_EN_.docx \n \n1.2.5.11 Metal detector \nBehind the belt weigher, there is the second metal detector installed to recognize remaining undetected metal \nparts in the material flow. After detection of metal foreign bodies, a discharge station gets activated to \nfacilitate identification of the relevant location. In case of detection of metal parts in the material flow, the metal detector stops the belt conveyor. The metal detector is composed of a frame with a search coil. The metal detector generates an \nelectromagnetic field. If a metal object enters the field, the measurement signal is deflected in a certain \ndirection. When the metal object leaves the field, a deflection occurs in the opposite direction. If both \ntriggering limits of the signal are exceeded, the metal relay is switched. An electronic circuit with an adjustable trigger enables the detection and display of metal elements. An easy access to the conveyor is provided in the selecting line section. 1.2.5.12 Safety devices \nAll exposed rotating parts with the exception of the idlers are protected against accidental contact by boxes, \nwire mesh guards or railings. In cases of emergency the equipment can be turned off by means of emergency switches with relevant pull \ncords installed on both sides of the conveyor line. Actuation of the pull rope triggers immediately standstill of \nthe conveyor and of the technologically interconnected conveying devices. Visual and acoustic start-up signals are provided by a warning lamp and a horn. Safety and warning devices include also: \nâ Limit switches for take-up way limit, \nâ Misalignment switch, \nâ Speed sensor and/or slip controller, \nâ Belt damage control, \nâ Filling level sensor of hopper, \nâ Supplying of LED-lamps for the entire conveyor.
