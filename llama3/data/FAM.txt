Repair 
1.4.1 Basic Safety Notes 
 
DANGER 
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY! 
All repair work must be realized only at wind speeds up to maximum 5 m/s. During 
the repairs, the wind speed must not exceed 10 m/s! 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER DUE TO UNINTENDED RE-START! 
Prior to repair, the conveying routes affected and upstream conveyors of machines 
must be made empty. Suitable actions are required to ensure that such equipment 
cannot be started by mistake. 
Starting of the electrical or hydraulic drives of the assembly groups that are being 
worked on, must be excluded. 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY! 
In case repair work technology makes it necessary to erect piles between ground 
level and machine, the load carrying capacity of soil must be calculated before the 
piles are erected (the permitted ground pressure need to be complied). 
The piles must be erected on a ground level sufficiently able to take the maximum 
load. 
The size of the piles must be selected according to the permitted ground pressure 
and the imposed load. 
The piles must be secured against overturning. 
In this process need to be ensured that the piles are positioned vertically and 
centrically under the support points. 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY! 
In case of using mobile lifting devices, the load carrying capacity of soil must be 
calculated before (the permitted ground pressure need to be complied). 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER DUE TO OBJECTS FALLING DOWN! 
For all repair works it is forbidden to stay under the repair area! This area has to be 
closed off across a large area. 
Falling objects may cause severe bodily injury or loss of life.

DANGER 
WARNING! RISK OF INJURIES CAUSED BY SPRING TENSION/CHAIN TENSION! 
When installing or removing components under mechanical stresses, persons might 
suffer injuries and equipment parts may become damaged or even destroyed.  
Before performing work on such components suitable action should be taken to 
exclude such potential risks. 
 
 
DANGER 
RISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS 
The conveying belt is always under tension, even while a belt conveyor is switched 
off. In the case of works where the conveyor belt exerts a direct or indirect effect, 
pretension must be neutralized by relieving the conveyor belt before starting the 
work. This might result in a short movement of the conveyor belt and the take-up 
device. 
 
 
DANGER 
RISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS 
For all belt-drive repair works suitable measures (e.g. belt clamps) have to be used 
to secure the conveyor belt against self-actuated movement. 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER DUE TO MISSING OR NOT CORECTLY INSTALLED SAFETY APPLIANCES  
After repair all safety devices must be checked for mounting and function and a 
start-up test without transported material must be realized! 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY! 
Repair works at 
 
Spherical bearings of the bridge segments 
 
Hoisting -and levelling cylinder 
 
Main carrying construction 
As well as the disassebly of machine parts of the crawler drive notably affect the 
stability of the entire plant. That is why these works may only be carried out after 
having consulted the company FAM and only by qualified maintenance personnel. 
Non-observance of this instruction may lead to damages at the plant, severe or even 
fatal injuries.

IMPORTANT 
In case of repair where fitting bolts or fitting bolt connections are to be removed, 
the parts concerned shall be properly marked so that they can be re-installed in 
the correct positions! 
If the fitting bolt connections have been removed, in the course of reassembly 
they should be replaced by new bolts with a thicker fitting shaft. Conjointly the 
holes should be bored to a larger size.

1.7.6 Adjustment of Crushing Gap 
1.7.6.1 
Principles 
 
 
DANGER 
Prior to repair work, run the Semi mobile crushing station empty and put it out of 
operation. 
Block the impact crusher, the adjacent apron feeder and the spillage conveyor in a 
way preventing the machine from any undesired movements. 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
Check the crushing result through regular analyses. Correct the gap width as 
appropriate in order to compensate wear. 
The final grain size distribution can be varied by operating the adjustment 
spindles for correction of the gap existing between rotor and impact rockers.

1.7.6.2 
Adjusting the crushing gap 
The final grain size distribution can be varied by operating the adjustment spindles for correction of the gap 
existing between rotor and impact rockers. 
 
 
NOTE 
Coarse final grain size: 
 
Large crusher gap width 
Fine final grain size:  
 
Small crusher gap width 
 
 
The following values have been pre-set by the manufacturer: 
Crusher gap A: 
 
250 mm 
Crusher gap B: 
 
150 mm 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
Adjustment procedures must be carried out evenly to ensure the parallelism of 
impact rockers relative to the rotor axis! 
 
 
NOTE 
Depending on the material to be crushed, the crusher gap pre-set by the 
manufacturer may be required larger or smaller. The gap width actually required 
should be determined on site. 
 
 
1.7.6.2.1 Increasing the gap 
 With the machine at rest, evenly loosen the external adjustment nuts II on both adjustment spindles by one 
turn in counterclockwise direction. 
 After that, tighten both external adjustment nuts I of both adjustment spindles gradually and evenly up to one 
turn in clockwise direction. 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
The thread of adjustment spindles has a pitch of 6 mm. One turn of adjustment nut 
corresponds to a correction of the impact rocker by some 10 mm. 
 
 Repeat this operation in parallel on both adjustment spindles until the desired crushing gap is obtained.

 Repeat this operation in parallel on both adjustment spindles until the desired crushing gap is obtained. 
 
 
1.7.6.2.3 Securing the new gap 
 Once the desired gap width is reached in each single case, tighten the external adjustment nut I gradually 
and evenly and lock it with the external adjustment nut II. 
 Operate the rotor by „HAND“ and check if the blow bars are free, t.i., they do not collide with other parts.

 The tensioning or relieving operation itself is made by means of the three outside tensioning spindles M48 
(75 mm across flats). To avoid distortion of the tensioning frame, the tensioning spindles must be operated 
evenly. 
 
Mark the measuring distance „M“ (1000 mm) on the free V-belt. 
 
Now tension the V-belts until the measuring distance „M“ of 1000 mm set during initial installation 
increases to 1009 mm. In this case the drive is under the correct tension. 
 
If the drive must be re-tensioned, the V-belts must be relieved from tension again so that they can be 
re-measured in a tension-free condition. Mark the measuring distance „M“ (1000 mm) on the free back 
of V-belt. Now tension the V-belts until the measuring distance „M“ increases from 1000 mm to 1006 
mm. Thus, the drive is re-tensioned correctly. 
 
 
WARNING 
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES 
During displacement of drive station note that distances are changing. The risk of 
bruising of limbs is present. 
 
 After the tensioning operation, be sure that the six fastening bolts of tensioning frame are retightened with a 
torque of approx. 2100 Nm.

Repair 
1.4.1 Basic Safety Notes 
 
DANGER 
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY! 
All repair work must be realized only at wind speeds up to maximum 5 m/s. During 
the repairs, the wind speed must not exceed 10 m/s! 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER DUE TO UNINTENDED RE-START! 
Prior to repair, the conveying routes affected and upstream conveyors of machines 
must be made empty. Suitable actions are required to ensure that such equipment 
cannot be started by mistake. 
Starting of the electrical or hydraulic drives of the assembly groups that are being 
worked on, must be excluded. 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY! 
In case repair work technology makes it necessary to erect piles between ground 
level and machine, the load carrying capacity of soil must be calculated before the 
piles are erected (the permitted ground pressure need to be complied). 
The piles must be erected on a ground level sufficiently able to take the maximum 
load. 
The size of the piles must be selected according to the permitted ground pressure 
and the imposed load. 
The piles must be secured against overturning. 
In this process need to be ensured that the piles are positioned vertically and 
centrically under the support points. 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY! 
In case of using mobile lifting devices, the load carrying capacity of soil must be 
calculated before (the permitted ground pressure need to be complied). 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER DUE TO OBJECTS FALLING DOWN! 
For all repair works it is forbidden to stay under the repair area! This area has to be 
closed off across a large area. 
Falling objects may cause severe bodily injury or loss of life.

DANGER 
WARNING! RISK OF INJURIES CAUSED BY SPRING TENSION/CHAIN TENSION! 
When installing or removing components under mechanical stresses, persons might 
suffer injuries and equipment parts may become damaged or even destroyed.  
Before performing work on such components suitable action should be taken to 
exclude such potential risks. 
 
 
DANGER 
RISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS 
The conveying belt is always under tension, even while a belt conveyor is switched 
off. In the case of works where the conveyor belt exerts a direct or indirect effect, 
pretension must be neutralized by relieving the conveyor belt before starting the 
work. This might result in a short movement of the conveyor belt and the take-up 
device. 
 
 
DANGER 
RISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS 
For all belt-drive repair works suitable measures (e.g. belt clamps) have to be used 
to secure the conveyor belt against self-actuated movement. 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER DUE TO MISSING OR NOT CORECTLY INSTALLED SAFETY APPLIANCES 
After repair all safety devices must be checked for mounting and function and a 
start-up test without transported material must be realized! 
 
 
DANGER 
DANGER FOR THE STABILITY! 
Repair works at 
 
Spherical bearings of the bridge segments 
 
Hoisting -and levelling cylinder 
 
Main carrying construction 
As well as the disassebly of machine parts of the crawler drive notably affect the 
stability of the entire plant. That is why these works may only be carried out after 
having consulted the company FAM and only by qualified maintenance personnel. 
Non-observance of this instruction may lead to damages at the plant, severe or even 
fatal injuries.

IMPORTANT 
In case of repair where fitting bolts or fitting bolt connections are to be removed, 
the parts concerned shall be properly marked so that they can be re-installed in 
the correct positions! 
If the fitting bolt connections have been removed, in the course of reassembly 
they should be replaced by new bolts with a thicker fitting shaft. Conjointly the 
holes should be bored to a larger size.

Belt Conveyors U1 – U5 
1.5.1 Replacement of Conveyor Belt 
 
 
NOTE 
For documentation of the conveyor belt refer to Manual 7, Register 4. 
 
 
DANGER 
RISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS 
The conveying belt remains under stress even when the belt conveyor is switched 
off. In case of work when the conveyor belt exerts a direct or indirect effect, 
pretension must be neutralized by relieving the conveyor belt before starting the 
work. This might result in a short movement of the conveyor belt and the take-up 
device. 
 
The conveyor belt must be constantly monitored for damages due to foreign substances. Any damage to the 
conveyor belt should be repaired as soon as possible. Minor damage can be repaired directly on the belt. 
Damage to the belt edges is also part of such immediate repairs. 
More extensive damage to the conveyor belt must be eliminated by the removal of the damaged belt section. 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
Work to the conveyor belt, vulcanisation and improvement of the damaged 
location(s) are to be carried out by certified specialist contractors. 
All connection and vulcanisation works must be executed by following precisely 
the instructions of the belt and fastening material manufacturer. 
 
Replacement of conveyor belt 
 Run the conveyor belt empty 
 If emptying is not possible, remove material from the belt manually 
 
 
DANGER 
 
ATTENTION IN CASE OF WORK IN ELEVATED POSITIONS! 
Maintenance personnel realizing cleaning work on the conveyor belt must use a 
catching safety belt and/or personal safety equipment for protection against falling! 
Failure to observe this precaution could result in severe bodily injury or loss of life.

 Move the conveyor belt in such a way that the intended sectioning point is well accessible. 
 Relieve the scrapers from tension and fold them back. 
 Lift the inner belt cleaner from the belt and fix it 
 Relieve the conveyor belt completely from tension (U1 see section 1.5.2.1, U2-U4 see section 1.5.2.2, U5 
see section 1.5.2.3) 
 Disconnect the belt conveyor from the power supply (enable) and protect it against unauthorised, erroneous 
and unintentional restart 
 Disengage clamping plates with rubber sealings of the feeding hopper or, if necessary, remove them. 
 Disassemble protective devices and covers to the extent required. 
 Clamp the conveyor belt next to the intended sectioning point in both directions to prevent it from sliding. 
 Align the belt coil with the new belt on two brackets with tubular axis to the belt axis 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
Platform for the belt coil: 
It must be ensured that the platform is placed horizontally with a safe standing 
position. 
 
 Disconnect the conveyor belt 
 Attach the new conveyer belt of the same quality to the old belt ending. 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
Make sure that the running and the carrying sides are not mistaken when 
positioning the conveyor belt! 
When installing the conveyor belt, it must be able to move freely in the direction of 
conveyance (running direction) over the carrying rollers as well as over all belt 
pulleys. For this purpose, it must be constantly checked, via visual inspection, that 
the conveyor belt cannot get jammed at any point or come into contact with sharp-
edged parts of the frame structure! 
 
 
WARNING 
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES 
When mounting the conveyor belt, make sure that hands, arms or other limbs are 
not between the conveyor belt and the carrying rollers or between the conveyor belt 
and the belt pulley!

 The installation of the conveyor belt may be carried out under observation of the instructions mentioned 
above. In case of different belt lengths, it may be necessary to install the conveyor belt in steps in order to 
ensure the vulcanising of the required belt joints. Here, it should also be ensured that, when making the 
conveyor belt endless from several individual lengths, a belt type test of each individual length must be 
carried out. 
 The installed conveyor belt must be secured against sliding back. 
 After the entire conveyor belt is positioned and braced firmly at one end, the other belt end is tightened until 
the conveyor belt tightly embraces all belt pulleys and rests evenly on the carrying rollers. 
 After the other end is also safely connected, the conveyor belt can be made endless / vulcanized. For this 
purpose, see assembly instructions of the belt suppliers. 
 Remove all devices (belt clamps) after production of the splice connection. 
 Re-assembly of the dismounted parts and/or components in reversed order under observance of following 
instructions: 
– Before tensioning the conveyor belt, check again the ease of movement. The belt is then tensioned 
according to the instructions provided for the take-up station (U1 see section 1.5.2.1, U2-U4 see section 
1.5.2.2, U5 see section 1.5.2.3). 
– Adjust the clamping plates with rubber sealings on the feeding hopper. 
– Adjust the scrapers (see the manufacturer´s instructions). 
– Remove the inner belt cleaner fixation.

Relieve the belt from tension 
 Run the conveyor belt empty 
 Relieve the belt completely from tension by uncoiling the tensioning rope until the belt is free 
 If necessary, pull the take-up carriage in the foremost position using appropriate hoisting devices 
 Check if the rope is properly placed to the rope sheaves. 
 
 
WARNING 
WARNING, DANGER OF SQUEEZING INJURIES 
During the tensioning operation it must be ensured that the rope is properly pulled 
through all rope sheaves. 
Be careful when attaching or threading the rope in the rope sheaves. There is a risk 
of squeezing off limbs! 
All maintenance personnel must wear gloves! 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
When the maximum take-up length is reached, the belt needs to be shortened. If 
the dimension sinks below this value, the rope will not be properly wound on the 
rope drum anymore!

Weight-tensioned take-up pulley 
 
 
NOTE 
Applicable to the conveyor U5. 
 
The conveying belt is tensioned via a weight-operated take-up station. This station ensures a constant tension 
of the conveying belt without any re-adjustment of the take-up system. 
 
Relieving / tensioning the belt 
 Run the conveyor belt empty 
 Disconnect the belt conveyor from the power supply (enable) and protect it against unauthorised, erroneous 
and unintentional restart 
 Lift and remove the take-up weight to relieve the belt from tension (use the middle mounting beam). See also 
section 1.5.4.6. 
 Tensioning of the belt is performed in reversed order. Note following instructions:

 Bleed the next oil pump and connect it up to the next oil channel (in Figure 5: oil channel II) 
 Apply pressure (see Oil pressures for coupling halves 1 and 2) to the oil channel, until oil emerges from the 
adjacent oil channel (in Figure 5: oil channel I). 
 Bleed the next oil pump and connect it up to the next oil channel (in Figure 5: oil channel I). 
 Apply pressure (see Oil pressures for coupling halves 1 and 2) to the oil pump until a ring of oil emerges at 
both end faces. 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
Note the sequence! 
During the entire operation the pressure must be maintained at a constant level on 
all the oil channels to which pressure is applied. 
If, when pressure is applied, oil emerges to the extent that pressure cannot be 
maintained, a thicker oil type must be specified. 
 
 Only when an unbroken ring of oil emerges from both end faces and a subsequent waiting period of approx. 
30 minutes is over, pressure can be applied to the hydraulic cylinder to slide the coupling hub smartly off the 
shaft. 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
Note stroke of hydraulic cylinder! If re-adjustment is necessary, the end face of 
the hydraulic cylinder must stop between 2 oil channels. 
 
 After detaching, the oil pumps and retaining device must be removed from the coupling hub. 
 The hub bore and the shaft should be examined for damage and protected against rust. Damaged parts 
must be replaced. 
 
 
Re-assembly of a flange coupling half 
 
 At the beginning of the mounting operation sufficient hoisting gears must be available. 
 Undo the plug screws G ¼ from the coupling half (see Figure 5, Pos. 5) and thoroughly clean all parts and 
shaft ends. The parts to be joined must be absolutely dry and free from grease. The oil channels and the oil 
circulation grooves may not show any contaminations. 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
Under no circumstances lubricate the fitting surfaces with grease containing 
molybdenum sulphite (Molykote, etc.).

DANGER 
Protection against burning is required due to hot parts. Wear protective clothing! 
Avoid heat loss (determination during mounting process)! 
 
 The coupling halves must be placed in warm condition: 
 
Heat the coupling half 1 to approx. 255°C before shrink fitting. 
 
Heat the coupling half 2 to approx. 245°C before shrink fitting. 
 Protect seal rings (see Figure 5, Pos. 6) from heat. 
 The warming up can be carried out inductively or in the oven. 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
The joining temperature must not exceed 300°C! 
 
 The coupling must be quickly pulled onto the shaft until it is flush with the shaft front. Use suitable hoisting 
gears. Ensure that no fit seats are damaged. 
 Secure the coupling hub on the shaft with a suitable face plate or holding device until it has cooled. 
 The cooling of the joined parts must take place as even and slow as possible (use heat-insulating bases and 
cover the joint, if possible). 
 After cooling of the coupling hub to the ambient temperature, the oil channels must be filled with clean oil 
(e.g. ISO VG 150) and closed with the plug screws G ¼ for purposes of rust protection (see Figure 5, Pos. 5, 
6). 
 Tighten the connecting bolts of the coupling halves with the specified tightening torque of 1050 Nm.

1.5.5 Elimination of Belt Misalignment 
 
 
IMPORTANT 
The requirement for a proper straight running is the exact alignment of all 
components. 
Belt misalignment can be caused by material accumulations on idlers or pulleys. 
Before carrying out further works, this must be checked. Material accumulations 
must be removed. 
 
 
The straight running of the belt is influenced by the corresponding setting of the carrying idlers and pulleys. 
The following applies to carrying idlers: 
 The belt always runs to the side it meets first. 
 
 
The following applies in general: 
 Even small adjustment angles (α) cause lateral movements. 
 The shifting (influencing) is effected slowly. The conveyor belt must be monitored for a longer period of time 
to ensure that it does not move to the opposite side. 
 Slanted pulleys achieve significantly stronger effects and are therefore often the cause for misalignment. 
Therefore, only the correct alignment and straight position should be checked. Adjustment for the steering of 
the belt should be avoided. 
 Multi-part carrying idler stations are often equipped with a so-called camber of the two outer side rollers. In 
normal position, these rollers are aligned symmetrically askew to the running direction of the belt. If such 
stations are installed in the wrong direction, they cause misalignment. The direction of installation must be 
checked. 
 Measures taken to eliminate misalignment must be recorded in order to have hints on possible causes for 
future problems so the initial condition can be restored.

1.5.6 Repair Work at the Tensioning Device U2-U4 
1.5.6.1 
Basic principles 
 
 
DANGER 
Prior to repair and maintenance work, the respective conveying line and the 
upstream conveying line must be made empty. 
Isolate conveyor from power supply and secure it against unauthorized, erroneous 
and unintended start-up. 
 
 
DANGER 
RISK OF SQUEEZING-OFF LIMBS 
The conveying belt remains under stress even when the belt conveyor is switched 
off. In case of work when the conveyor belt exerts a direct or indirect effect, 
pretension must be neutralized by relieving the conveyor belt before starting the 
work. This might result in a short movement of the conveyor belt and the take-up 
device. 
 
 If components of the tensioning device which affect the holding force, such as geared motor, cable drum 
etc., are scheduled for disassembly, the conveyor belt must be relieved from tension before start of the 
repair work, and the take-up carriage must be moved to the end position and secured against moving. The 
individual components can then be disassembled after they have been attached to a suitable hoist and the 
appropriate fastening screws have been loosened. 
 Installation of the components is realised in the reversed order. In this connection, particular attention must 
be paid to the firm seating of the fastening elements. The pre-tension of the belt must be subsequently set by 
the equipment user! 
 Re-install all protective devices.

POTENTIAL HAZARDS CAUSED BY ELECTRIC POWER 
POTENTIAL RISK OF AUTOMATIC OR UNINTENDED START OF MACHINE 
Only qualified electricians should carry out work on the power supply system. 
Make sure that machine and plant equipment subject to compulsory inspections, 
repair and maintenance work are isolated from power before such work is carried 
out. To be sure, check the isolated equipment items if they are still under voltage. 
Earth and short-circuit them and isolate other equipment in the vicinity from power 
supply. 
Prior to all repair and erection work, the equipment and its components should be 
isolated from power supply so that drives cannot be started by mistake while repair 
work is carried out. 
All cable connections of components to be replaced must be disconnected. After 
reassembly, cable connections must be made again! 
 
 Run the conveyor belt empty 
 Relieve the conveyor belt completely from tension (U1 see section Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht

NOTE 
Applicable to the electro-magnetic separator 452-130 installed at the belt conveyor U5 
 
 
NOTE 
For documentation of the magnetic separator refer to Manual 7, Register 8. 
 
 
DANGER 
Prior to repair and maintenance work, the respective conveying line and the 
upstream conveying line must be made empty. 
Isolate conveyor from power supply and secure it against unauthorized, erroneous 
and unintended start-up. 
 
 Run the conveyor belt empty. 
 Disconnect the belt conveyor from the power supply (enable) and protect it against unauthorised, erroneous 
and unintentional restart. 
 Switch off the drive unit of the magnetic separator and ensure that it cannot be switched on. 
 Disconnect the power cables of the magnetic separator. 
 Sling the roof (weight approx. 680 kg) to a suitable hoisting gear, dismount it and lower safely on the ground. 
 
 
DANGER 
CAUTION, SUSPENDED LOADS! 
Persons are not permitted to stay or work under suspended loads. Every movement 
must be continuously monitored by several persons. The operator and monitoring 
personnel must always remain in contact. 
 
 Sling the magnetic separator (weight approx. 5050 kg) including the frame (weight approx. 1000 kg) through 
the lifting eyes to a suitable hoisting gear and secure against movement. 
 Disconnect the plate flanges between the frame and supports.  
 Lift the magnetic separator together with the frame from the supports and lower the unit onto a suitable 
transportation vehicle.  
 
 
DANGER 
In case of necessity, the magnetic separator may only be placed at locations where 
the load capacity for acceptance of its weight is provided. There, the magnetic 
separator must be secured against movement. 
Non-compliance with this instruction can cause damage to the components as well 
as severe injuries or lethal outcome of personnel.

Maintenance tasks and interventions in the functional system may be executed by authorised and trained staff only. During work on the hydraulic system (replacement of components or 
maintenance) the electric actuators must be free of current and the device concerned must be depressurised. Shut-off valves are to be closed, pumps turned off, pressure accumulators 
discharged. Closed valves and open switches are to be fixed with a warning sign: “Do not turn on. Maintenance work underway". Tighten fittings only in a depressurised state. When replacing 
valves, pumps, filter elements etc., use only original spare parts. If electrical control elements have been replaced, proper integration into the locking conditions must be tested. Switching points 
and output signals must be checked.

DESIGN AND FUNCTION 
1.1 
General Description 
Semi-mobile crushing equipment is used for transporting coal, mixed with xylitol, from a nearby open cast 
mining to an open air coal storage (not in scope of supply) inside a power plant. 
The entire equipment consists of two main components: 
 Crusher station for twin truck feeding, 
 Belt conveyor system with 1 line for feeding the power plant open air stockpiles. 
The crusher station is designed to feed an apron feeder by trucks from 2 sides. During unloading, trucks 
dump the coal-xylitol-mix through a hopper to the loading surface of the apron feeder. It starts and carries the 
material along a slope to its top point and discharges the load into a chute with a running impact crusher 
below. 
Big lumps of coal and long pieces of xylitol are cracked inside the crusher immediately and the outgoing 
material falls through a chute to the loading table of the first belt conveyor with flowing sequence. 
The conveyor system consists of a continuous belt conveyor line involving conveyors U-1 to U-5 with a 
common length of 2937m.  
In the immediate vicinity of the crusher station, there is an operator cabin installed to control the handling 
process of the crushing station and the belt conveyor system. This cabin is designed for a continuous 
presence of an operator.

1.2 
Feeder Hopper 
The feeder hopper accepts material discharged by dump trucks from the loading ramps, which are designed 
in a way allowing the trucks to approach the hopper backwards from two sides. The hopper is made as a solid 
robust construction. Its material guide walls are lined with RCH1000 plates. The base frame and supporting

1.3 
Apron Feeder AF 2200 x 15 
1.3.1 General Notes 
The apron feeder is a flat steel plate conveyor. It is the first drive in the conveying sequence and has a 
capacity of three truck loads (two truck unloading ramps allow double unloading). During unloading operation, 
the coal falls from the dump truck into a hopper at which base the apron feeder is situated. The material is 
transported along a slope to the top point of the apron feeder where it is discharged into a further chute, which 
guides the coal directly into the crusher. Capacitive material detectors on the ground and on top report to the 
control system if the chute is filled or free for a new truck unloading operation. 
The apron feeder consists basically of following main components: 
– main frame, 
– apron strand, 
– driven tumbler, 
– drive unit,  
– take-up unit, 
– set of rollers, 
– set of impact rails.

1.3.3 Apron Strand  
The apron strand consists of individual aprons. The pulling unit is formed by means of two track chains which 
are arranged in the double-link style. 
The individual aprons are fastened on the chain links. The gap between adjacent aprons is closed with a seal 
so that material cannot penetrate between the aprons even when moving around the sprocket wheels. 
The aprons are fabricated in welded design. 
The complete apron strand is guided in the upper run by means of rigidly fixed and maintenance-free track 
rollers. Below the apron strand, there are arranged impact rails which absorb the loading impact resulting 
from feeding operation. 
The return rollers are installed on both sides under the aprons. These rollers run on rails fitted to the carrying 
frame in the return strand. The chain is guided over a drive sprocket and a return sprocket.

Spillage Conveyor KGF 2490 x 15,1 
1.4.1 General Notes 
The spillage conveyor is located below the apron feeder. It is aimed to remove any coal pieces falling from the 
lower run of the apron feeder. The material falls through between the upper run scrapers of the spillage 
conveyor and is further transported by its lower run scrapers to a spillage chute. 
The spillage chute guides the coal powder beside the crusher directly to the upper surface of the belt 
conveyor U-1. 
The spillage conveyor consists basically of following main components: 
– trough, 
– drive station, 
– take-up station.

1.4.4 Take-up Station 
The take-up station is designed as a spindle tensioning station. The necessary pre-tensioning of the chain 
strands is reached by turning the take-up spindles (on both sides). 
By turning the take-up spindles, the springs get tensioned (compressed) and the position of the sliding block 
changes. 
The springs are necessary to compensate the polygon effect of the chain sprockets and impacts. The sliding 
blocks accommodate the take-up shaft which holds chain sprockets supported by bearings. 
On the end faces of the tensioning shaft, there are provided grease nipples which supply the chain sprockets 
with lubricant.

1.5 
Impact Crusher PB 1822 PP 
1.5.1 General Notes 
The impact crusher beats the big lumps and xylitol pieces into small parts, which have the size of bulk 
material. Rotating at high speed (ca. 39 m/sec), the rotor placed in a housing lined with wear plates grasps 
the feed material with great force and throws it against impact rockers. The impact rockers with oscillating 
suspension are installed in the housing. 
The feed material is crushed between blow bars and impact rockers to the desired grain size. The impact 
rockers are arranged in a way so that the product is thrown back into the crushing radius. 
The output grain size can be determined and easily controlled from outside by adjusting the impact rockers, 
t.i., by altering the gap between the rotor and the impact rocker.  
Besides, the contact pressure can be changed by respective tensioning of the helical compression springs. 
The crushed material falls without time delay through the third chute onto the belt conveyor U-1 installed 
below the chute.

1.5.2 Drive Unit 
The impact crusher is driven by a narrow V-belt drive consisting of 18 V-belts 8V/25N with a pitch length of 
12700 mm. Tensioning and releasing of the tension is effected by three external take-up spindles.  
Drive unit and crusher have a fixed coupling via belt-drive. The motor and countershaft are connected via an 
elastic coupling. For that matter, the motor is energized via a frequency converter. Due to its volume, the 
running crusher has a high inertia torque and much kinetic energy. The FC allows a better and longer 
controlled start-up and shut-down after using. The start-up takes approx. 2 min. and the shut-down lasts 
about 5 min. 
To detect any slipping between the drive unit and the crusher there are speed sensors installed on both sides. 
Both values will be compared to detect slipping before a different speed causes friction and heat to the V-
belts, which connect both sides - the motor and the machine.

1.5.3 Hydraulic System 
The impact crusher is furnished with two hydraulic cylinders for the housing opening device. The cylinders of 
the machine are supplied by one hydraulic unit with which they are connected via pipe and hose lines. 
The cylinder pair is provided with a 4/3 directional valve on the hydraulic unit to actuate opening and closing 
operation of the crusher housing. 
Each cylinder is equipped with a load-holding valve to keep the cylinder in position and protect it against 
overloads

DESIGN AND FUNCTION 
1.1 
General description 
The belt conveying system with a crushing station are used for transporting coal, mixed with xylitol, from a 
nearby open cast mining to an open air coal storage (not in scope of supply) inside a power plant. 
The entire equipment consists of two main components: 
 Crusher station for twin truck feeding, 
 Belt conveyor system with 1 line for feeding the power plant open air stockpiles. 
The crushing station is designed to feed an apron feeder by trucks from 2 sides. During unloading, trucks 
dump the coal-xylitol-mix through a hopper to the loading surface of the apron feeder. It starts and carries the 
material along a slope to its top point and discharges the load into a chute with a running impact crusher 
below. 
Big lumps of coal and long pieces of xylitol are cracked inside the crusher immediately and the outgoing 
material falls through a chute to the loading table of the first belt conveyor with flowing sequence. 
The continuous conveyor line consisting of conveyors U-1 to U-5 transports the material further to the 
secondary crushing equipment. 
In the immediate vicinity of the crusher station, there is an operator cabin installed to control the handling 
process of the crushing station and the belt conveyor system. This cabin is designed for a continuous 
presence of an operator.

1.2 
Belt Conveyors BC U1 – U5 
The belt conveyor system performs transport of the coal received from the semi-mobile crushing equipment 
and delivers it to the secondary crushing equipment. The conveyor system consists of a continuous belt 
conveyor line involving conveyors U-1 to U-5 with a capacity of 1000 t/h and common final length of approx. 
2901 m. 
Almost at the end of the conveyor line, at the conveyor U-5, additional equipment is installed to check the 
incoming bulk material and to hold it clean. These are: 
 1 magnetic separator, 
 2 metal detectors before and after the separator and 
 1 belt scale. 
The belt conveyors are the key drives for material handling. These drives are only switchable from the local 
repair switch to enable the repair operation outside of interlocking. Further, each belt conveyor can be 
separately locked in manual mode when the following conveyor is running. If all conditions are met, all 
conveyors in the conveying line in the semi-automatic operation start counter to the conveying direction and 
stop in the conveying direction. 
In the locked and semi-automatic operation, separate and independent switching of individual promoters 
within the line is not possible. The sequence described above is observed in all cases. 
In an emergency situation the system can be immediately shut-down by opening the emergency stop loop. 
This can be done by pulling a ripcord or by pressing a hardware red mushroom emergency stop button or a

1.2.1 Intermediate Belt Conveyor U-1 
1.2.1.1 
General 
The belt conveyor U1 is a functional component of the coal conveying system between the semi-mobile 
crushing station and the second crushing plant. From the crushing station the crushed coal is transferred to 
the belt conveyor U1 which transports the material further to the hopper of the belt conveyor U2. 
The conveyor U1 is a relocated conveyor with an elevating structure. Depending on the mining progress, it 
can be shifted together with the semi-mobile crushing station. The belt conveyor U1 consists basically of the 
following components: 
 
Main frame, 
 
Drive station with drive pulley, 
 
Take-up station with take-up pulley, 
 
Feeding hopper, 
 
Discharge box with chute and adjustable baffle plate, 
 
Carrying idler stations, conveyor belt and belt cleaners, 


1.2.1.3 
Take-up station 
The take-up station is a spindle-operated tensioning station consisting of a moveable take-up sledge, a belt 
pulley and two take-up spindles. The conveyor belt coming from the drive pulley is guided in the lower run 
over carrying idler stations to the take-up sledge. The necessary belt pre-tension is reached by shifting the 
take-up sledge with the pulley by means of the spindles and spindle nuts. 
The sledge and the take-up spindles are installed in the steel construction. The tension way is built by two 
longitudinal beams which are welded to the frame on both sides. Lift-off restraints hold the take-up sledge on 
the longitudinal beams. The pedestal bearings of the take-up pulley are fastened on the take-up sledge. 
When installing the belt, the sledge should be brought into a definite position depending on the take-up way 
and secured there. 
The necessary pre-tension of the conveyor belt is effected by a mechanical pre-stressing (note the belt sag!). 
If due to the belt elongation the belt tension changes, it must be corrected by the take-up spindles. 
Before the take-up pulley, an inside belt cleaner is installed. 
 
1.2.1.4 
Feeding box 
The feeding box is located in the tail part (end section of U1) and is used for receiving of conveyed material 
from the crusher chute and spillage from the apron feeder. The feeding box is designed as a stable welded 
and bolted steel construction which rests on the steel substructure. 
The lateral walls of the hopper are lined with wear plates. The feeding box is sealed on both sides along the 
belt by adjustable rubber strips. 
In the feeding zone, reinforced carrying idler stations are applied with idler spacing of 300 mm. The feeding 
idler stations are fastened by means of bolted connections. 
The rubber curtains mounted in the feeding hopper are intended to reduce dust emissions. 
The hopper is protected by covers. 
 
1.2.1.5 
Pulleys 
The drive pulley has herringbone rubber lining and is supported by pillow blocks with anti-friction bearings 
with adapter sleeve. The shaft and pulley tube are connected by taperlock connections.  
The take-up pulley has plain rubber lining and is supported by pillow blocks with antifriction bearings with 
adapter sleeve. The shaft and pulley tube are connected by taperlock connections. 
 
1.2.1.6 
Idlers 
Rigid carrying idler stations consist of three idlers with equal length. The idlers are rigidly fastened to the idler 
supports. Rigid return idler stations consist of two idlers with equal length. The return run stations have rubber 
disc idlers in order to present very narrow surfaces for adhesion and thus to reduce the tendency for material 
build up. The idlers are rigidly fastened to the idler supports. Transfer points are equipped with impact idler 
stations with rigid fixtures.  
Idlers of the same type are interchangeable. The bearings are lubricated for lifetime.

1.2.5.9 
Magnetic separator 
The magnetic separator is a belt conveyor, which is orthogonally installed above the main conveyor U-5 
behind the return station. In the middle between the lower belt and the upper belt, there is installed a strong 
electrical magnet which separates any ferrous parts from the conveyed material flow while the conveyor is 
running. From the area in the middle it carries the undesirable metal components sideward, where the 
magnetic field is lower, and lets them fall into a collection container for recyclable metal parts. 
The metal piece discharge conveyor is hung in a steel construction with possibility of adjustment relatively to 
the conveyor line. The steel construction consists of an upper and lower part. The lower part is rigidly 
fastened in the concrete ground by means of anchor bolts in the bottom plates. 
The steel construction is located at the beginning of the conveyor bridge and protected against atmospheric 
effects by a roof. For the purposes of maintenance and assembly of the magnetic separator, the upper part of 
the steel construction can be removed and laid down sideways. 
The magnetic separator starts up only when the metal detector at the belt conveyor U-4 announces incoming 
metal and it runs for several minutes. The magnetic separator doesn’t run continuously together with the 
running conveyor U-5. 
 
1.2.5.10 Belt weigher 
The belt weigher is installed behind the feeding hopper U5. It is designed to acquire the instantaneous flow 
rate. The belt scale consists of at least one load cell, a speed sensor and the processing electronics. The load 
cell determines the weight of the load on a certain belt section (1 m), and the speed transducer measures the 
belt speed. The product of the two measured variables results in the current feed rate in t/h. The data 
provided are passed over to the existing interface of the PLC for further evaluation. 
The belt weigher is fastened on the stringers of the conveyor frame and equipped in the upper run with two 3-
piece idler stations for weight acquisition. The belt weigher is installed in the first frame section of the

In case of detection of metal parts in the material flow, the metal detector stops the belt conveyor. 
The metal detector is composed of a frame with a search coil. The metal detector generates an 
electromagnetic field. If a metal object enters the field, the measurement signal is deflected in a certain 
direction. When the metal object leaves the field, a deflection occurs in the opposite direction. If both 
triggering limits of the signal are exceeded, the metal relay is switched.  
An electronic circuit with an adjustable trigger enables the detection and display of metal elements. 
An easy access to the conveyor is provided in the selecting line section. 
 
1.2.5.12 Safety devices 
All exposed rotating parts with the exception of the idlers are protected against accidental contact by boxes, 
wire mesh guards or railings. 
In cases of emergency the equipment can be turned off by means of emergency switches with relevant pull 
cords installed on both sides of the conveyor line. Actuation of the pull rope triggers immediately standstill of 
the conveyor and of the technologically interconnected conveying devices. 
Visual and acoustic start-up signals are provided by a warning lamp and a horn. 
Safety and warning devices include also: 
– Limit switches for take-up way limit, 
– Misalignment switch, 
– Speed sensor and/or slip controller, 
– Belt damage control, 
– Filling level sensor of hopper, 
– Supplying of LED-lamps for the entire conveyor.

Commissioning Program 
 
1.1 General 
 
This Commissioning program is intended to describe step by step the commissioning activities and 
tests. It covers the period of time from mechanical completion right up to the Start-Up Procedures. 
 
Commissioning includes coordination of all individual activities (incl. those of the sub-suppliers) in 
order to provide production requirements and performance as contractually agreed to.  
 
All commissioning measures are allocated to the commissioning stages explained subsequently. 
The commissioning stages (fig. 1) contain the essential steps of preparation and execution of the 
commissioning activities of all by FAM supplied equipments.  
 
In general the commissioning procedures are sub-divided into the following steps. 
 
- Pre-commissioning  
- Commissioning (Functional and Interlocked Operation Test) without material 
- Commissioning with material 
 
These steps include all settings, adjustments and functional tests to that allow operability of the 
plant to operate without and with material (as specified in contract documents). 
 
The system consist: 
 
 Crusher Station for twin Truck feeding 
 Belt conveyor system consists of a continuous belt conveyor line U-1 to U-5 (with Magnet-
ic separator, Metal detector and belt scale).

1.2 Pre-commissioning 
 
The Pre-commissioning activities begin, as a rule, only after mechanical, electrical and control 
completion of the equipment. The Pre-Commissioning tests comprise all activities for testing the 
system controls.  
 
Before switching on (switch gear) for the first time, the contractor must submit the end of erection 
work. 
 
The Pre-commissioning tests require component suppliers to be present for the electrical and con-
trol equipment review and checkout.  
 
1.3 Commissioning without material 
 
The purpose of the commissioning procedure is to make adjustments and assure that the equip-
ment are ready for Commissioning with material. The Commissioning procedures contain the fol-
lowing two activities: 
- 
Functional Tests 
- 
Interlocked Operation Test 
 
1.3.1 Functional Tests 
 
Functional Tests are physical run tests of individual components without feed material. 
 
During the Functional Tests for example the following items are addressed: 
 
 Check all bearings for temperature and assure proper and sufficient lubrication, 
 Circulation control devices are checked for operation and sensitivity,  
 All limit switches are set and safety devices checked, 
 Mechanical settings such as tensioning and aligning the conveyors are rechecked, 
 Rotational direction of motors, power draw  
  and temperature are checked.

Specification, Sensor List and List of Power Consumption (Motor List) will form the basis for the 
Functional Tests. 
The switching state remaining after the functional test “disconnected” or “ready for operation” is 
determined in agreement with the client. Specific Lock-out-Procedures shall be arranged before 
starting the tests. 
 
Carrying out of the Functional Tests and readiness for Interlocked Operation Tests must be rec-
orded. 
 
1.3.2 Interlocked Operation Test 
 
These tests are conducted without operating the facility with feed material. 
 
These tests demonstrate the functionality of the equipment, including Start-Stop-sequences, inter-
locking and control and safety functions. For the equipment, this covers the entire system tests 
required prior the introduction of product. 
 
During the Testing, for example the following checks are carried out and operating possibilities are 
checked: 
 
 Functioning of the individual devices/control systems in interlocked operation, 
 Starting up and shutting down procedures including interlocks and permissives, 
 “Emergency-Stop” and starting up after “Emergency-Stop”, 
 Switching on and off interlockings of all operating possibilities, 
 Functioning of the safety devices during starting up and shutting down as well as in the 
case of malfunction changeovers, 
 Intended and actual parameters in interlocked operation. 
The specification and the contractual agreements are the basis for carry out the Interlocked Opera-
tion Test. 
 
On conclusion of a successful Interlocked Operation Test, the equipment are ready for start-up 
operation with material.

1.4 Commissioning with material 
 
Start-up of the facility occurs after commissioning and all interlocks and permissives have been 
checked. The feed material is introduced into the system for processing.  
 
The key function of the start up testing with feed is to assure that the settings without and with feed 
are within normal parameters. All interlocking possibilities and specified functions are run through 
and tested again under normal operating conditions and recorded. The tests shall be started with 
low load and after reaching suitable operating conditions shall proceed to design load.  
 
During the Commissioning with material, the following checks are carried out. 
 
 Check the material handling, 
 Set upper and lower limits and trigger values of the level indicators, 
 Set the signalling devices, 
 Start up  
 Start-up after “Emergency-Stop”, 
 Check settings of safety devices (hydraulic safety valves, shutdown switches, etc.) 
 
During the Start-Up-procedures of the components and function groups of the equipment are op-
erated in connection with the operating material. 
During this period all systems are checked und adjusted under various modes of operation and 
loading configurations.
